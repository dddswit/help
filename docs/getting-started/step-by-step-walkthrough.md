  The Workspace page is sort of like Grand Central Station for core services. This page contains a variety of elements, which can be categorized as follows: (1) the Features in the Left Sidebar—Integrated Search, Workspace List, All Activities, and All Mentions and (2) the Features on the middle section—Build a New Workspace.

 SWIT has kept the site fairly simple, which is a major part of its appeal. In helping its users focus on their tasks, SWIT has keep the pages free from distractions and made them easy to follow. As you will see below, some of the most notable features of our Workspace is that Workplace lets you see and search the activities and mentions of all the workplaces you participate in by displaying them in one place. Since Cross-Workplace chronologically presents the list of all the activities and mentions that you have missed in an organized, clean, and readable way, you can manage your activities and mentions from a single dashboard! (Workspace features can be added to the existing workspace home structure.)

  

 5.3.1

*The Feature in the Middle Section*: Build a New Workspace

 The Middle Section—Workspace List—is grouped into two categories: (1) My Workspace and (2) Browse Workspace. However, in order to use these features, you first need to build a workspace!
