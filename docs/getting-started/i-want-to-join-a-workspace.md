# I Want to Join a Workspace

 If you want to join a Workspace that has already been created, you will need to be invited by one of the Members of that Workspace. Please ask for an invitation from a Member with invitation privileges. If you would like to create your own Workspace, please refer to [Build a New Workspace](https://help.swit.io/feature/19021808473085p1BBi/1902180857514J9ytE3).

 ### I Donâ€™t Have a Swit Account

 A Swit account is necessary to create or join a Workspace. Please visit [this link](https://swit.io/auth/register) to create an account.

   
 ### Set Up Your Profile

 A Workspace is a space shared by multiple Members. It is important to set up your Profile so that other Members will recognize you. To manage your Profile, go to Account Settings.
