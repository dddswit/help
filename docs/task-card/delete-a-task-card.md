* Click [Delete Card].
  After you delete a Task Card, a bar will appear at the bottom of the screen informing you that the Task Card has been deleted successfully. You can only undo the deletion while this bar is at the bottom of the screen. To do so, simply click [Undo]. You will no longer be able to undo the deletion once the bar disappears.
