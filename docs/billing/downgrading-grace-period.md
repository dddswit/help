# Downgrading Grace Period

 Downgrading your Plan will decrease the storage space you will have. Once you Downgrade your Plan, storage will be hidden until grace period ends (depending on which Plan you currently have). See below for each Planâ€™s grace period.



**Free plan**- 1 month grace period  
**Standard Plan**- 2 month grace period  
**Premium Plan**- 3 month grace period  
**Enterprise Plan**- 6 month grace period. This Plan cannot be downgraded.

   
 If you decide to Upgrade your Plan again, the hidden storage will come back if it is within the grace period time. If it is not upgraded in the grace period time, storage will be permanently deleted.
