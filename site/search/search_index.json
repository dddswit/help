SSO authentication allows enterprise customers with large internal employees to register and manage multiple members of their domain account at once. If users use SSO, users can use Swit through an account managed by the company without registering. This reduces the risk of security such as password loss and weak password management. With SSO, system administrators no longer have to manage every employee's access to services. This can improve the efficiency of manpower utilization. Swit Premium supports SSO services through SAML 2.0, including G Suite & MS Azure and Okta. How to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) Desktop After opening a Swit Premium account, Premium Master or Premium Administrator will be able to sign up employees collectively through SSO authentication setup.

This feature is mainly used for the purpose of promoting organization within a team. Concerning the \u201cGroup\u201d function in the Workspace, workspace Masters and Administrators can create groups within the workspace. They can also add members to the created group. In addition, they can mention team members on a group basis or invite them to channels and projects.

If you choose this option , **your members must have a Swit account to log in. 1.4.2. The Second Option : This section allows your team members to use their own identity provider (i.e. G Suite or MS Azure) for logging in to Swit. In this case, Swit does not function as an Identity Provider. If you choose this option, your team members do not need to have a Swit username and password. This section will provide you with five inputs: (1) SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP), (2) Identity Provider Issuer, (3) Public Certificate, (4) Authentication range setting, and (5) Custom (optional).

Email Box : Please enter the email address of the person you would like to invite. You can add many at once. 1.3.2.1.2. Roles : You can assign the roles for the Members invited in advance: (1) Advanced Admin or (2) Advanced Member. 1.3.2.1.3. Groups : You can assign the groups for the Members invited in advance. Please click the \u201cAdd Groups\u201d box to see the existing groups in your Swit network. When you make a selection, your invitation is ready to be sent. 1.3.2.1.4. CSV : Swit allows you to invite members by a CSV file. If you want to use this function, please click \u201cInvite Members by CSV\u201d link. The link will lead you to the follow screen: Follow the step-by-step guide to use this fuction. 1.3.2.2.Invitation Sent: This feature is a real-time invitation tracker that gives you a way to quickly view the status of an invitation to a member. Upon sending an invitation to a member, you will see the tracker appear in this section, informing (1) the invitor, (2) the invitee, and (3) the invitation timestamp. When the invitee accepts the invitation, the tracker no longer appears in this section. 1.3.2.3.Invitation Accepted: When the invitee accepts the invitation, the tracker notifies the invitation sender that the invitee is successfully linked by providing the date accepted information. 1.3.3. Groups : The \u201cGroup\u201d function in the Workspace is different from the \u201cGroup\u201d function in the Administration. Concerning the \u201cGroup\u201d function in the Administration, Advanced Masters and Advanced Administrators can create groups and add members from Dashboard to the group. This feature is mainly used for the purpose of promoting organization within a team. Concerning the \u201cGroup\u201d function in the Workspace, workspace Masters and Administrators can create groups within the workspace. They can also add members to the created group. In addition, they can mention team members on a group basis or invite them to channels and projects. The middle section of the screen will display (1) Create Groups, (2) Group name and (3) the number of members in each group. 1.3.3.1. Create Groups : In this section, you can create a new group. When you click the \u201cCreate Groups\u201d link, the \u201cCreate Group\u201d page will appear. Here, you can name groups and add group descriptions. I will create the \u201cAAA\u201d group to demonstrate. Once a group is created, the newly created group will appear on the \u201cGroups\u201d section: 1.3.3.2. Add Members : Click the checkbox next to the \u201cAAA\u201d group in order to add a member. Once you have clicked the checkbox, a new box will appear beneath the \u201cGroups\u201d header. It will display how many groups have been selected and a \u201cEdit\u201d dropdown button. Please click the \u201cEdit\u201d dropdown button and then click the \u201cAdd Members to the Groups\u201d link. The following box will appear on your screen. In the space provided, type the name of the member that you would like to invite. The member that you have chosen is then added to the group. However, there is a hidden feature in this section. Bringing the cursor on the right of the numerical indicator displays how many members are in the group. Swit will display an icon with three dots. Clicking the icon will give you four options: (1) View the Members, (2) Add the Members to the Group, (3) Modify the Group, and (4) Delete the Group. 1.3.3.2.1. View the Members : This section allows you to view who is in the group, along with his or her email address. 1.3.3.2.2. Add the Members to the Group : You can add more members in this section. Please type the name of the members that you desire to add in the group. 1.3.3.2.3. Modify the Group : Here, you can change the group name along with the group description. 1.3.3.2.4. Delete the Group : This section lets you delete the group. Please note that once you choose to delete the group, all information will be lost and you can\u2019t undo this action. 1.4. Authentication : You can control how your team members sign in. Two options will be given to you under the \u201cAuthentication Management\u201d section: (1) \u201cMembers Sign in with an Account and Password Created in Swit,\u201d (2) \u201cMembers Sign in Using SALM.\u201d By default, the \u201cAuthentication Management\u201d is set to option 1 unless you specify otherwise. 1.4.1.** The First Option : This is a traditional log-in method, which requires a username and password to log in. If you choose this option , **your members must have a Swit account to log in. 1.4.2. The Second Option : This section allows your team members to use their own identity provider (i.e. G Suite or MS Azure) for logging in to Swit. In this case, Swit does not function as an Identity Provider. If you choose this option, your team members do not need to have a Swit username and password. This section will provide you with five inputs: (1) SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP), (2) Identity Provider Issuer, (3) Public Certificate, (4) Authentication range setting, and (5) Custom (optional). Please follow the steps below to set up SSO (Single sign-on). 1.4.2.1. SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP) : Please enter your SMAL 2.0 Endpoint. This is where you go when you try to login. 1.4.2.2. Identity Provider Issuer : Please type the name of your Identity Provider (i.e. G Suite or MS Azure). 1.4.2.3. Public Certificate : This is where you enter your Identity Provider x.509 Certificate. 1.4.2.4. Authentication Range Setting : The members have to use the following authentication methods in the Swit Technologies Inc space: (1) \u201cAll member sign in through SSO\u201d, (2) \u201cSign in using either the \u2018Normal\u2019 or \u2018SSO\u2019, depending on Member selection.\u201d Please choose one that most fits your needs. 1.4.2.5. Custom (Optional) : Here, you can add a SSO login screen image. 1.4.2.6.Once the setup has been completed, emails will be sent out to all members. 1.5. Setting : This section allows you to control setting information for Sign Up mode. Here, you can choose whether (1) only those invited to Swit Technologies Inc Dashboard by invitation can be joined or (2) both those invited and those who have specific domain address form can be joined. By default, the \u201cSetting for Sign Up Mode\u201d is set to \u201cAllowing only those who have been sent an invitation\u201d unless you specify otherwise. Please choose one that most fits your needs. 1.6. Billing : There are five branches under the \u201cBilling\u201d section: (1) Overview, (2) Payment Details, (3) Payment Method, (4) Billing Address, and (5) Payment Contact. 1.6.1.

Zapier is an online automation tool that lets you connect your apps, such as Gmail, Team Projects, and more, to each other. You can connect two or more apps to automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration. It's easy enough that anyone can build their own app workflows with just a few clicks. What is Swit? Swit is San Francisco-based fastest growing remote working tool, which offers chat and tasks in one platform. Due to this revolutionary combination, Swit grants its users to easily monitor team collaboration. You can use our chat and tasks as remote working tools that can be particularly effective for remote participants to work together, allowing them to perform a collaborative dialogue or other group activity. How does it work? In your Zapier account, your apps can be connected to work together. Each connection is called a \u201cZap.\u201d With a Zap, you can set one of your selected apps to perform a specific action (called \"Trigger\"), which then would trigger the other app to perform a set action (called \"Action\"). For example, let\u2019s say that you wish to push Gmail to a Swit project every time you receive a new email. The trigger, in this case, would be the new email in Gmail and the new project created in the Swit project through the trigger would be the Action. Zapier offers two types of triggers: (1) Polling Trigger and (2) Instant Trigger. When using the Polling Trigger, Zapier will check for a new update from your trigger every 1 to 15 minutes, depending on your subscription plan. When using the Instant Trigger, your trigger app will send Zapier an instant notification whenever there is a new update. Gmail & Swit The purpose of this section is to demonstrate how to set up Zapier to automatically push data from Gmail to Swit. In order for Zapier to perform this task, you must first connect Gmail and Swit to Zapier. This will give Zapier secure access to read and/or write data to those apps. Please login to your Zapier and then follow the step-by-step directions below. Please keep in mind that, during setup, you\u2019ll need to have your login credentials ready for all of the apps you want to connect. Getting Started On the left-hand side of the screen, you find the Make a New Zap button when you hover your mouse cursor over the + sign. Click on the link to proceed. When this happens ... You will be directed to the \u201c1. When this happens \u2026\u201d page. Under Choose App & Event, search for and select the \u201cGmail\u201d app that will trigger the Zap. Then, select the Choose Trigger Event dropdown menu, which will provide a list of available connections. New Email Matching Search: Triggers when you receive a new email that matches a search string you provide. New Thread: Triggers when a new thread starts. New Email: Triggers when a new e-mail appears in the specified mailbox. New Labeled Email: Triggers when you receive a new email and label it within two days. New Starred Email: Triggers when you receive a new email and star it within two days. New Attachment: Triggers when you receive a new attachment (triggers once per attachment). New Label: Triggers when you add a new label. Choose one that best fits your needs. I will choose New Email to demonstrate. Then press Continue to proceed. Moving onto the next step, you will be asked to connect your G Suite Gmail account with Zapier. If you are already logged in to your Gmail account, you will only need to allow Zapier to access your Google Account. Click on the dropdown and choose your Gmail account. Press Continue to proceed. Customize Email allows you to select which new emails with which specific label or mailbox get sent to Swit (The possible selections are as follows: Chat, Sent, Inbox, Import, Trash, Draft, Spam, Category_Forums, Category_Updates, Category_Personal, Category_Promotions, Category_Social, Stared, and Unread). If no label or mailbox is selected, this Zap will trigger on all emails, including Drafts. For this example, we will select Inbox. To do so, click on the dropdown button at the right of the Label/Mailbox, and select Inbox. Once you have moved on to the next step, you\u2019ll be asked either to select Test & Review, Test & Continue, or Skip Test. To run the test, click Test & Review or Test & Continue. It should be noted that, for the Trigger test to work, you must already have at least one email in your Gmail Inbox. If you want to use different sample data, you can change the sample data in your Zap trigger. When you first set up your Zap trigger, Zapier will attempt to find some sample data from your Gmail mail boxes to use in the Zap. For example, if your trigger brings in data from your mailbox, Zapier will pull in an item of Trigger (i.e., New Email)--If Zapier is having trouble finding data for your trigger, try adding new data for the event in your trigger app. he sample row can then be used as test data in an action step later in the Zap. If you want to first review the data that Zapier pulls from your mailbox, click on Test & Review. Otherwise, click on Test & Continue (If Zapier finds an example item, you\u2019ll proceed to set up the rest of your Zap) or Skip Test to move onto the action. Please ensure any fields labelled as \u201crequired\u201d are completed. Do this ... In the blank box under Choose App & Event, search for Swit and add it in. Then look through the action events in Choose Action Event to find the one you want. Create Message: Posts a message on a channel you select Create Ideas: Posts an idea on a channel you select Create Task: Creates a task in a project you select Create Comment on Task: Posts a comment to a task you select I will choose Create Task to demonstrate. Click on Continue to proceed. Moving onto the next step, you need to connect your Swit account. Click on the Choose Account dropdown menu and select your existing Swit account. Once you have made the selection, click Continue. You will then be prompted to Customize Task, where you can customize the data that you want to send over to your action app, Swit. When there is a field with an arrow on the right, click the arrow to choose from available options.

How to use special features in M Box. Let There Be Link 1.1. Start : Go to your workspace and locate the \u201cM Box\u201d button on the left navigation bar. Click on the button to proceed. 1.2. Making the Connection : Once you have clicked on the button, the following screen will appear. In order to use M Box, you need to link your G Suite account to your Swit. It should be noted that you must have G Suite account with Gmail enabled to make the integration. This being said, the integration cannot be made with other account.

You have successfully integrated your G Suite into Swit! Now, you are ready to use M Box. Now that you have linked your email account in M \u200b\u200bBox, you can use various functions provided by M Box. We now turn to this topic. The Link is Very Good The purpose of this section is to demonstrate how to effectively use the \u201cM Box\u201d features, with particular focus on the basic functions that M Box provides. In the next section, however, I will go deeper into the special features that M Box can provide. Let\u2019s begin! 2.1. Inbox : As soon as Swit and G Suite are connected to each other, the initial mailing list loads up to 20 emails. After that, you get 20 lists each time you scroll. 2.2. Account Information : The linked account information is displayed at the bottom left. 2.3. Deletion : If you want to remove the integration, move the cursor onto the icon with three dots. Clicking on the icon will give you the following message: \u201cDelete the Linked account in M Box.\u201d Click on it to proceed. Once you have clicked the message, the following warning will be displayed as shown in the picture below: \u201cWill you delete the linked \u2018your email address\u2019 in M Box? You can link the account again in M Box if you delete the account.\u201d Confirm to remove the linked account. 2.4. Refresh : Default is to auto refresh every 3 minutes. However, you can manually refresh your email database by clicking the cycle arrow icon in the \u201cMail List\u201d menu. Since, email data is not updated in real time, you must press the refresh button to load new mail data. 2.5. Composition : It is time to compose an email. Locate the \u201cCompose\u201d button on your screen and click on it. I will send an email to Sanghwan.a.lee@gmail.com to demonstrate. Of course, you can attach files stored on your computer. Please click on the \u201cAttachment\u201d button to use this feature. In the Content Browser, you can navigate through folders in different locations, search for a file, and then attach it. Once you have finished writing a message and attaching the file, click on the \u201cSend\u201d button on the top of the screen. Then, the confirmation indicator will be displayed, as shown in the picture below. Great job! As seen, two options will be given to you: (1) Move to \u201cinbox\u201d and (2) Move to \u201csent\u201d email box. Please choose what fits best for your next task and then click on it. I will choose the latter option to demonstrate. 2.6. Sent : Do you see what is in the red box? It shows the most recently sent email via M Box! 2.7. Policy : Since we integrate G Suite to Swit\u2019s platform without altering the former\u2019s email usage policy, Swit follows G Suite\u2019s policy. The followings are some examples of the rules: (1) Gmail Sending Limit, (2) Gmail Receiving Limit, (3) Attachment, (4) Carbon Copy, (5) Blind Carbon Copy. Gmail Sending Limit : This feature sets the maximum amount of emails that you can send in a day. You can send 500 emails/day with a regular Gmail account. Gmail Receiving Limit : This feature sets the maximum amount of emails that you can receive in a day. You can receive 500 emails/day with a regular Gmail account. Attachment : For example, when you send files larger than 25MB, Google automatically uploads them to Google drive. Carbon Copy (CC): This feature allows you to send an email to multiple recipients. However, when you use this feature, the primary recipients of the email will be aware of other recipients you have included. Hence, the CC feature ensures that all your recipients can see who has been added to your mail. Blind Carbon Copy (BCC): This feature allows you to send an email to multiple recipients. Yet, this feature will not allow the primary recipients of the email to be aware of other recipients you\u2019ve included. Hence, it\u2019s a little more confidential than CC. The Special Features are Very, Very Good The purpose of this section is to demonstrate two special features that M Box offers to our users: Transforming a Swit task card into an email and vice versa . Additionally, I will show you how to share any email directly to your chat. 3.1. From a task card to an email : Please locate an icon with two rectangles in the right sidebar. When you hover over the icon, M Box will show the \u201cchannels\u201d and \u201ctask cards\u201d entries in a popup. Click on the \u201cTasks\u201d button to proceed. Once you have clicked on the button, the Tasks window will be displayed on your screen as shown in the screenshot below. The first line under the title \u201cTasks\u201d demonstrates a selected project in your workspace. Clicking on the dropdown menu will further show you all the existing projects so that you can pick and choose. I will choose the \u201cTypos\u201d project to demonstrate. The second dropdown menu will show you all the existing Task Cards in Bucket Views. It should be noted that you can view your Task Cards in five different views, each serving a specific purpose: (1) Status View, (2) Team View, (3) Timeline View, (4) Calendar View, and (5) Bucket View. I will choose the \u201cWebsite\u201d Bucket View to demonstrate. As you see, using the dropdown menu narrows down a search by specifying the desired options. Guess what? It is time to turn this Task Card entitled \u201cTypo on Pricing Information on Website\u201d to email content. Are you ready? Click on the \u201cCompose\u201d button to open an email screen. Once the email screen has appeared as below, move the mouse cursor over to the Task Card. Now, just simply drag and drop the Task Card to the email screen. The magic is about to begin! Are you ready? Wow! As shown in the screenshot below, the contents have been transferred from the Task Card to the email in message form. Let\u2019s compare the original form and the email form to see how accurately the transfer took place. As you can see below, it worked like a charm! The Original Form The Email Form Here, I want to point out one more amazing feature. Notice that the \u201cdrag and drop\u201d action has automatically included one email account in the To section and two email accounts in the CC section. This inclusion has taken place because those account holders have been assigned as the Assigned member (i.e. ian@swit.io) and as the followers (i.e., sophia@swit.io and jina@swit.io) of the Task Card. The \u201cdrag and drop\u201d action intuitively recognizes this information and automatically includes them in the corresponding sections. Isn\u2019t this amazing? Now, the email is ready to be sent! Guess what? There is another way to transform a Task Card into an email. Please go to any Task Card that you desire to transform and locate the icon with three dots. When you click on it, a box with five options will appear. Choose the \u201cSend mail\u201d option. Then Swit will transform the selected Task Card into an email! 3.2. From an Email to a Task Card : Let\u2019s say that you have received an email. You can transform it into a shareable and trackable Task Card! First, go to the \u201cInbox\u201d section and locate the Task Card that you have received in email form. Once you have clicked on it, the following screen will appear. Locate the \u201cGenerate the Task by Email\u201d button on the top middle section on the task bar. Then click on it to proceed. Magic is about to happen! Once you have clicked on the button, the following screen will appear. Here you can choose the Project you want to send the email to as well as give a name to your Task. In the dropdown menu under the \u201cSelect Project\u201d section, I will choose the \u201cIntegration Walkthrough\u201d project to demonstrate. Guess what? You can also change the \u201cTake Tile\u201d name to best fit your need. I will change the title from \u201cTypo on Pricing Information on Website\u201d to \u201cM Box Integration Walkthrough Demon\u201d to demonstrate. Then I will write \u201cDemonstrate\u201d in the \u201cDetails\u201d box to demonstrate. It is time to click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button. Once you have clicked on it, the following screen will appear. I will choose to go to task details. Then, you will be led to a newly generated Task Card page. Congratulations! You have successfully transferred an email to a Task Card! Yet, there is more to see! Please locate the email emoticon and click on it. A box will appear on your screen, showing the contents of the email that you use to generate this Task Card. This feature will save you from going back and forth to view the contents of the email to recapture your work. 3.3. From an Email to a Task Card : Surprisingly, you can share email directly to your chat. Let\u2019s say that you have an email that you want to share in team chat. What you first need to do is open the email in M Box. Then, locate an icon with two rectangles in the right sidebar. When you hover over the icon, M Box will show the \u201cchannels\u201d and \u201ctask cards\u201d entries in a popup. Click on the \u201cChannel\u201d icon to proceed. Once you have clicked on the icon, the \u201cChannel\u201d bar will be displayed, as shown in the picture below. It is time to locate the \u201cShare Mail into the Chat\u201d link and then click on it. Then the following box will appear on your screen. Here you can choose which channel to use as the destination for the email. I will choose the \u201cSFDC integration\u201d channel and write \u201cDemo\u201d in the \u201cDescription\u201d box to demonstrate. Then, click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button to proceed. Do you see what I see? Look at the bottom right side of your screen. You have successfully shared the email! Now, let\u2019s click the \u201cSwit Empowers Salesforce\u201d link. Once you have clicked the link, the content of the email will appear in the reading pane. Isn\u2019t this amazing? You can share email directly to your chat, and the chat members get instantly updated on the email without having to open their inbox! Guess what? There is another way to share email directly to your chat. First, locate the email that you want to share in team chat. Second, simply drag and drop the email to the Chatting box. When the \u201cShare Your Mail\u201d box appears, choose what fits best for your task and then click the \u201cConfirm\u201d button. I will choose the \u201cSFDC integration\u201d Channel and write \u201cDemo 2\u201d in the \u201cDescription\u201d box to demonstrate. Then, click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button to proceed. Now, look at the bottom right side of your screen. Congratulations! You have successfully shared the email! Final Remarks M Box lets you manage your tasks professionally and intuitively in just a few clicks. This evolutionary function that Swit proudly provides will help your company pop and allow it to get the job done like a real pro. With M Box, you can get ahead of the competition. Guess what?

Once you have clicked the message, the following warning will be displayed as shown in the picture below: \u201cWill you delete the linked \u2018your email address\u2019 in M Box? You can link the account again in M Box if you delete the account.\u201d Confirm to remove the linked account. 2.4. Refresh : Default is to auto refresh every 3 minutes. However, you can manually refresh your email database by clicking the cycle arrow icon in the \u201cMail List\u201d menu. Since, email data is not updated in real time, you must press the refresh button to load new mail data. 2.5. Composition : It is time to compose an email. Locate the \u201cCompose\u201d button on your screen and click on it. I will send an email to Sanghwan.a.lee@gmail.com to demonstrate. Of course, you can attach files stored on your computer. Please click on the \u201cAttachment\u201d button to use this feature. In the Content Browser, you can navigate through folders in different locations, search for a file, and then attach it. Once you have finished writing a message and attaching the file, click on the \u201cSend\u201d button on the top of the screen. Then, the confirmation indicator will be displayed, as shown in the picture below. Great job! As seen, two options will be given to you: (1) Move to \u201cinbox\u201d and (2) Move to \u201csent\u201d email box. Please choose what fits best for your next task and then click on it. I will choose the latter option to demonstrate. 2.6. Sent : Do you see what is in the red box? It shows the most recently sent email via M Box! 2.7. Policy : Since we integrate G Suite to Swit\u2019s platform without altering the former\u2019s email usage policy, Swit follows G Suite\u2019s policy. The followings are some examples of the rules: (1) Gmail Sending Limit, (2) Gmail Receiving Limit, (3) Attachment, (4) Carbon Copy, (5) Blind Carbon Copy. Gmail Sending Limit : This feature sets the maximum amount of emails that you can send in a day. You can send 500 emails/day with a regular Gmail account. Gmail Receiving Limit : This feature sets the maximum amount of emails that you can receive in a day. You can receive 500 emails/day with a regular Gmail account. Attachment : For example, when you send files larger than 25MB, Google automatically uploads them to Google drive. Carbon Copy (CC): This feature allows you to send an email to multiple recipients. However, when you use this feature, the primary recipients of the email will be aware of other recipients you have included. Hence, the CC feature ensures that all your recipients can see who has been added to your mail. Blind Carbon Copy (BCC): This feature allows you to send an email to multiple recipients. Yet, this feature will not allow the primary recipients of the email to be aware of other recipients you\u2019ve included. Hence, it\u2019s a little more confidential than CC. The Special Features are Very, Very Good The purpose of this section is to demonstrate two special features that M Box offers to our users: Transforming a Swit task card into an email and vice versa . Additionally, I will show you how to share any email directly to your chat. 3.1. From a task card to an email : Please locate an icon with two rectangles in the right sidebar. When you hover over the icon, M Box will show the \u201cchannels\u201d and \u201ctask cards\u201d entries in a popup. Click on the \u201cTasks\u201d button to proceed. Once you have clicked on the button, the Tasks window will be displayed on your screen as shown in the screenshot below. The first line under the title \u201cTasks\u201d demonstrates a selected project in your workspace. Clicking on the dropdown menu will further show you all the existing projects so that you can pick and choose. I will choose the \u201cTypos\u201d project to demonstrate. The second dropdown menu will show you all the existing Task Cards in Bucket Views. It should be noted that you can view your Task Cards in five different views, each serving a specific purpose: (1) Status View, (2) Team View, (3) Timeline View, (4) Calendar View, and (5) Bucket View. I will choose the \u201cWebsite\u201d Bucket View to demonstrate. As you see, using the dropdown menu narrows down a search by specifying the desired options. Guess what? It is time to turn this Task Card entitled \u201cTypo on Pricing Information on Website\u201d to email content. Are you ready? Click on the \u201cCompose\u201d button to open an email screen. Once the email screen has appeared as below, move the mouse cursor over to the Task Card. Now, just simply drag and drop the Task Card to the email screen. The magic is about to begin! Are you ready? Wow! As shown in the screenshot below, the contents have been transferred from the Task Card to the email in message form. Let\u2019s compare the original form and the email form to see how accurately the transfer took place. As you can see below, it worked like a charm! The Original Form The Email Form Here, I want to point out one more amazing feature. Notice that the \u201cdrag and drop\u201d action has automatically included one email account in the To section and two email accounts in the CC section. This inclusion has taken place because those account holders have been assigned as the Assigned member (i.e. ian@swit.io) and as the followers (i.e., sophia@swit.io and jina@swit.io) of the Task Card. The \u201cdrag and drop\u201d action intuitively recognizes this information and automatically includes them in the corresponding sections. Isn\u2019t this amazing? Now, the email is ready to be sent! Guess what? There is another way to transform a Task Card into an email. Please go to any Task Card that you desire to transform and locate the icon with three dots. When you click on it, a box with five options will appear. Choose the \u201cSend mail\u201d option. Then Swit will transform the selected Task Card into an email! 3.2. From an Email to a Task Card : Let\u2019s say that you have received an email. You can transform it into a shareable and trackable Task Card! First, go to the \u201cInbox\u201d section and locate the Task Card that you have received in email form. Once you have clicked on it, the following screen will appear. Locate the \u201cGenerate the Task by Email\u201d button on the top middle section on the task bar. Then click on it to proceed. Magic is about to happen! Once you have clicked on the button, the following screen will appear. Here you can choose the Project you want to send the email to as well as give a name to your Task. In the dropdown menu under the \u201cSelect Project\u201d section, I will choose the \u201cIntegration Walkthrough\u201d project to demonstrate. Guess what? You can also change the \u201cTake Tile\u201d name to best fit your need. I will change the title from \u201cTypo on Pricing Information on Website\u201d to \u201cM Box Integration Walkthrough Demon\u201d to demonstrate. Then I will write \u201cDemonstrate\u201d in the \u201cDetails\u201d box to demonstrate. It is time to click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button. Once you have clicked on it, the following screen will appear. I will choose to go to task details. Then, you will be led to a newly generated Task Card page. Congratulations! You have successfully transferred an email to a Task Card! Yet, there is more to see! Please locate the email emoticon and click on it. A box will appear on your screen, showing the contents of the email that you use to generate this Task Card. This feature will save you from going back and forth to view the contents of the email to recapture your work. 3.3. From an Email to a Task Card : Surprisingly, you can share email directly to your chat. Let\u2019s say that you have an email that you want to share in team chat. What you first need to do is open the email in M Box. Then, locate an icon with two rectangles in the right sidebar. When you hover over the icon, M Box will show the \u201cchannels\u201d and \u201ctask cards\u201d entries in a popup. Click on the \u201cChannel\u201d icon to proceed. Once you have clicked on the icon, the \u201cChannel\u201d bar will be displayed, as shown in the picture below. It is time to locate the \u201cShare Mail into the Chat\u201d link and then click on it. Then the following box will appear on your screen. Here you can choose which channel to use as the destination for the email. I will choose the \u201cSFDC integration\u201d channel and write \u201cDemo\u201d in the \u201cDescription\u201d box to demonstrate. Then, click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button to proceed. Do you see what I see? Look at the bottom right side of your screen. You have successfully shared the email! Now, let\u2019s click the \u201cSwit Empowers Salesforce\u201d link. Once you have clicked the link, the content of the email will appear in the reading pane. Isn\u2019t this amazing? You can share email directly to your chat, and the chat members get instantly updated on the email without having to open their inbox! Guess what? There is another way to share email directly to your chat. First, locate the email that you want to share in team chat. Second, simply drag and drop the email to the Chatting box. When the \u201cShare Your Mail\u201d box appears, choose what fits best for your task and then click the \u201cConfirm\u201d button. I will choose the \u201cSFDC integration\u201d Channel and write \u201cDemo 2\u201d in the \u201cDescription\u201d box to demonstrate. Then, click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button to proceed. Now, look at the bottom right side of your screen. Congratulations! You have successfully shared the email! Final Remarks M Box lets you manage your tasks professionally and intuitively in just a few clicks. This evolutionary function that Swit proudly provides will help your company pop and allow it to get the job done like a real pro. With M Box, you can get ahead of the competition. Guess what? This walkthrough is just the tip of the iceberg. There is plenty more to discover and be surprised about!","title":"G Suite Integration"},{"location":"integrations/integrate-zoom/","text":"Integrate Zoom Features The Zoom integration enables users to schedule Zoom meetings while staying in a Swit workspace and supports sharing scheduled meetings with workspace members through invitations in channels or links with task cards.

The workspace master or admin of all the tiers of the Swit platform\u2014Free, Standard, Advanced, and Advanced Plus\u2014can make integrations between Swit and SFDC. SFDC users also can make integrations with Swit, only when they belong to the following tiers of the SFDC platforms: Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Performance. So, are you ready to make the integration? Let\u2019s start! 1. From Creation to Authorization Choose a workspace that you want to integrate with SFDC and click on it. I will choose the \u201cSwit Tech\u201d workspace to demonstrate. Once you have clicked on the selected workspace, you will be directed to the inside of the workspace. Locate the \u201cStore\u201d button on the bottom left corner and click on it to proceed. Now, a new screen will appear. Please locate the \u201cSalesforce\u201d link on the left corner and click on it. Once you have clicked on the \u201cSalesforce\u201d link, the following screen will appear. Click the \u201cConnection\u201d link to proceed. You will be directed to a screen entitled \u201cSalesforce,\u201d where you can begin to synchronize SFDC and Swit. Locate the \u201c+Add Connection\u201d button on the upper right corner and click on it. Then, a new box entitled \u201cNew Connection\u201d will appear, asking you to name the connection that you desire to make. I will name the connection \u201cWalkthrough (Test)\u201d to demonstrate. Once you have clicked on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button, the indicator that you have tried to make SFDC and Swit integration will appear on a screen, but with a \u201cNot Authorized\u201d label under \u201cStatus\u201d. Please click the \u201cAuthorize\u201d link in order to make the integration. The \u201cAuthorize Connection\u201d box will then appear and ask you to choose your SFDC environment: (1) Production, (2) Sandbox. Please choose one that fit your needs. I will choose \u201cProduction\u201d to demonstrate. Once you have made your choice, click the \u201cAuthorize\u201d button to continue. You will be directed to the SFDC\u2019s login page. A SFDC account is required to integrate SFDC with Swit, and, here, you will first login to connect your account. After entering your login information, you will be asked to choose either deny or allow access. Click \u201cAllow\u201d to grant access. You are now ready to integrate SFDC with Swit. Please return to the screen entitled \u201cSalesforce,\u201d where you previously saw the \u201cNot Authorized\u201d label. Now, the label is changed to \u201cAuthorized,\u201d ensuring SFDC and Swit\u2019s synchronization. If you want to revoke access for SFDC and Swit\u2019s connection on this object, click on the \u201cRevoke Access\u201d button, then follow the instructions. It should be noted that there is a hidden feature in the \u201cSalesforce\u201d section. Once you bring the cursor on the right side of \u201cRevoke Access,\u201d Swit will display an icon with three dots. Clicking the icon will give you two options: (1) Edit, (2) Disconnect. The \u201cEdit\u201d button allows you to change the name of the SFDC and Swit connection. The \u201cDisconnection\u201d button will enable you to disconnect the SFDC and Swit link. Note that this feature will disconnect all associated tasks on the object. 2. From Authorization to Configuration Users can specify the objects and corresponding fields in SFDC\u2014i.e. Account, Contacts, Lead, Opportunity, Task, Case, List Email, Report, Group, Note, Content Document\u2014that they can access through this connection. Click the \u201cConfigure\u201d link to specify the objects and corresponding fields in SFDC. Once you have clicked on the \u201cConfigure\u201d button, the \u201cAvailable Salesforce Objects\u201d screen will appear for you to add or remove SFDC objects. Locate the \u201c+ Add Salesforce Object\u201d link on the upper right corner and click on it. The \u201cAdd Salesforce Object\u201d box will then appear on your screen. Bring the cursor to the gray box, where it says \u201cPlease select an object.\u201d Click on it to proceed. The dropdown will provide you several SFDC objects that are not currently in your \u201cAvailable Salesforce Objects\u201d screen. Please choose one that fits your need, one at a time. I will select \u201cContent Document\u201d to demonstrate. Click the \u201cConfirm\u201d button to proceed. As you will see below, the \u201cContent Document\u201d object is now included in the \u201cAvailable Salesforce Objects\u201d screen. You have successfully added an object! If you want to remove any objects from the \u201cConnect Salesforce Objects\u201d screen, simply click the \u201cRemove\u201d button under \u201cOperations.\u201d The following warning then will appear to make sure you want to disconnect the connection: \u201cOnce disconnected, all linked SFDC objects on the Swit task card will disappear.\u201d As you know, every SFDC object has fields attached to it. Swit allows you to add fields to the object by simply clicking the \u201cFields\u201d button under \u201cOperations.\u201d I will choose \u201cContent Document\u201d to demonstrate. Once you have clicked on the \u201cFields\u201d button, the window entitled \u201cContent Document Fields\u201d will appear on your screen. Bring the cursor on the gray box, where it says \u201cAvailable Field,\u201d and click on it. The dropdown provides available fields, allowing you to choose one value from a list. Here, you can specify corresponding fields of the object in SFDC that you can access through this connection. I will choose \u201cTitle\u201d to demonstrate. One you have clicked on \u201cTitle,\u201d the \u201c+Add\u201d button which was grayed out on the right side of the box will turn blue, indicating that the \u201cTitle\u201d is ready to be add on the object you have selected. Click on the \u201c+Add\u201d button to proceed. Now, you see that the \u201cTitle\u201d field is bumped up to the parent node: selected fields. Click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button to finalize your choice. Once you have clicked the \u201cConfirm\u201d button, the following message will appear on your left bottom screen: \u201cThe field has been updated successfully.\u201d 3. From Configuration to Application If you want to go back to your \u201cWorkspace List\u201d screen, click the \u201cHome\u201d button on the bottom of the left-hand menu. Click the icon to proceed. The browser will then be redirected back to the \u201cWorkspace List\u201d screen. Since you have chosen the \u201cSwit Tech\u201d workspace to demonstrate, click the workspace to check its synchronization with SFDC. Once you have clicked on the selected workspace, you will be directed to the inside of the workspace. Locate the \u201cProject Box\u201d button and click on it. Now, we need to create a project. Locate the \u201c+\u201d button in the \u201cProjects\u201d box and click on it. This feature will give you two options: (1) Create Project and (2) Create Folder. Click the \u201cCreate Project\u201d button. Once you have clicked on the \u201cCreate Project\u201d button, the following box will appear on your screen so that you can name the project. I will name the project \u201cIntegration Walkthrough\u201d to demonstrate and confirm it. As you see, the \u201cIntegration Walkthrough\u201d project has been created. It is time to create a project card. Locate the \u201c+Add a Card\u201d button and name the card. Then, click on the \u201cEnter/Return\u201d button to proceed. I will name the card \u201cExample\u201d to demonstrate. The Project card entitled \u201cExample\u201d has been successfully created. Please double-click the card to display the card\u2019s details. The screen above demonstrates the card\u2019s details. As you see, the SFDC logo appears on the bottom of the right-hand side of the page in the card, ensuring that the \u201cSwit Tech\u201d workspace has been successfully integrated with SFDC. The logo is displayed when there is at least one authorized connection. Yet, notice that no Salesforce objects have not yet linked with this card. Hence, it is time to link the SFDC objects with this card. Click the \u201cAssociate\u201d link. The following screen entitled \u201cAssociate\u201d will appear on your screen. First, we need to choose a connection. Click the \u201cPlease select a connect\u201d dropdown. This will provide a list of available connections.

Yes! As you see, you have successfully made a change from the SFDC!","title":"Salesforce Integration"},{"location":"integrations/salesforce-integration/#salesforce-integration","text":"Swit and Salesforce.com Integration The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how to connect Swit to Salesforce.com (hereafter SFDC). The workspace master or admin of all the tiers of the Swit platform\u2014Free, Standard, Advanced, and Advanced Plus\u2014can make integrations between Swit and SFDC. SFDC users also can make integrations with Swit, only when they belong to the following tiers of the SFDC platforms: Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Performance. So, are you ready to make the integration? Let\u2019s start! 1. From Creation to Authorization Choose a workspace that you want to integrate with SFDC and click on it. I will choose the \u201cSwit Tech\u201d workspace to demonstrate. Once you have clicked on the selected workspace, you will be directed to the inside of the workspace. Locate the \u201cStore\u201d button on the bottom left corner and click on it to proceed. Now, a new screen will appear. Please locate the \u201cSalesforce\u201d link on the left corner and click on it. Once you have clicked on the \u201cSalesforce\u201d link, the following screen will appear. Click the \u201cConnection\u201d link to proceed. You will be directed to a screen entitled \u201cSalesforce,\u201d where you can begin to synchronize SFDC and Swit. Locate the \u201c+Add Connection\u201d button on the upper right corner and click on it. Then, a new box entitled \u201cNew Connection\u201d will appear, asking you to name the connection that you desire to make. I will name the connection \u201cWalkthrough (Test)\u201d to demonstrate. Once you have clicked on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button, the indicator that you have tried to make SFDC and Swit integration will appear on a screen, but with a \u201cNot Authorized\u201d label under \u201cStatus\u201d. Please click the \u201cAuthorize\u201d link in order to make the integration. The \u201cAuthorize Connection\u201d box will then appear and ask you to choose your SFDC environment: (1) Production, (2) Sandbox. Please choose one that fit your needs. I will choose \u201cProduction\u201d to demonstrate. Once you have made your choice, click the \u201cAuthorize\u201d button to continue. You will be directed to the SFDC\u2019s login page. A SFDC account is required to integrate SFDC with Swit, and, here, you will first login to connect your account. After entering your login information, you will be asked to choose either deny or allow access. Click \u201cAllow\u201d to grant access. You are now ready to integrate SFDC with Swit. Please return to the screen entitled \u201cSalesforce,\u201d where you previously saw the \u201cNot Authorized\u201d label. Now, the label is changed to \u201cAuthorized,\u201d ensuring SFDC and Swit\u2019s synchronization. If you want to revoke access for SFDC and Swit\u2019s connection on this object, click on the \u201cRevoke Access\u201d button, then follow the instructions. It should be noted that there is a hidden feature in the \u201cSalesforce\u201d section. Once you bring the cursor on the right side of \u201cRevoke Access,\u201d Swit will display an icon with three dots. Clicking the icon will give you two options: (1) Edit, (2) Disconnect. The \u201cEdit\u201d button allows you to change the name of the SFDC and Swit connection. The \u201cDisconnection\u201d button will enable you to disconnect the SFDC and Swit link. Note that this feature will disconnect all associated tasks on the object. 2. From Authorization to Configuration Users can specify the objects and corresponding fields in SFDC\u2014i.e. Account, Contacts, Lead, Opportunity, Task, Case, List Email, Report, Group, Note, Content Document\u2014that they can access through this connection. Click the \u201cConfigure\u201d link to specify the objects and corresponding fields in SFDC. Once you have clicked on the \u201cConfigure\u201d button, the \u201cAvailable Salesforce Objects\u201d screen will appear for you to add or remove SFDC objects. Locate the \u201c+ Add Salesforce Object\u201d link on the upper right corner and click on it. The \u201cAdd Salesforce Object\u201d box will then appear on your screen. Bring the cursor to the gray box, where it says \u201cPlease select an object.\u201d Click on it to proceed. The dropdown will provide you several SFDC objects that are not currently in your \u201cAvailable Salesforce Objects\u201d screen. Please choose one that fits your need, one at a time. I will select \u201cContent Document\u201d to demonstrate. Click the \u201cConfirm\u201d button to proceed. As you will see below, the \u201cContent Document\u201d object is now included in the \u201cAvailable Salesforce Objects\u201d screen. You have successfully added an object! If you want to remove any objects from the \u201cConnect Salesforce Objects\u201d screen, simply click the \u201cRemove\u201d button under \u201cOperations.\u201d The following warning then will appear to make sure you want to disconnect the connection: \u201cOnce disconnected, all linked SFDC objects on the Swit task card will disappear.\u201d As you know, every SFDC object has fields attached to it. Swit allows you to add fields to the object by simply clicking the \u201cFields\u201d button under \u201cOperations.\u201d I will choose \u201cContent Document\u201d to demonstrate. Once you have clicked on the \u201cFields\u201d button, the window entitled \u201cContent Document Fields\u201d will appear on your screen. Bring the cursor on the gray box, where it says \u201cAvailable Field,\u201d and click on it. The dropdown provides available fields, allowing you to choose one value from a list. Here, you can specify corresponding fields of the object in SFDC that you can access through this connection. I will choose \u201cTitle\u201d to demonstrate. One you have clicked on \u201cTitle,\u201d the \u201c+Add\u201d button which was grayed out on the right side of the box will turn blue, indicating that the \u201cTitle\u201d is ready to be add on the object you have selected. Click on the \u201c+Add\u201d button to proceed. Now, you see that the \u201cTitle\u201d field is bumped up to the parent node: selected fields. Click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d button to finalize your choice. Once you have clicked the \u201cConfirm\u201d button, the following message will appear on your left bottom screen: \u201cThe field has been updated successfully.\u201d 3. From Configuration to Application If you want to go back to your \u201cWorkspace List\u201d screen, click the \u201cHome\u201d button on the bottom of the left-hand menu. Click the icon to proceed. The browser will then be redirected back to the \u201cWorkspace List\u201d screen. Since you have chosen the \u201cSwit Tech\u201d workspace to demonstrate, click the workspace to check its synchronization with SFDC. Once you have clicked on the selected workspace, you will be directed to the inside of the workspace. Locate the \u201cProject Box\u201d button and click on it. Now, we need to create a project. Locate the \u201c+\u201d button in the \u201cProjects\u201d box and click on it. This feature will give you two options: (1) Create Project and (2) Create Folder. Click the \u201cCreate Project\u201d button. Once you have clicked on the \u201cCreate Project\u201d button, the following box will appear on your screen so that you can name the project. I will name the project \u201cIntegration Walkthrough\u201d to demonstrate and confirm it. As you see, the \u201cIntegration Walkthrough\u201d project has been created. It is time to create a project card. Locate the \u201c+Add a Card\u201d button and name the card. Then, click on the \u201cEnter/Return\u201d button to proceed. I will name the card \u201cExample\u201d to demonstrate. The Project card entitled \u201cExample\u201d has been successfully created. Please double-click the card to display the card\u2019s details. The screen above demonstrates the card\u2019s details. As you see, the SFDC logo appears on the bottom of the right-hand side of the page in the card, ensuring that the \u201cSwit Tech\u201d workspace has been successfully integrated with SFDC. The logo is displayed when there is at least one authorized connection. Yet, notice that no Salesforce objects have not yet linked with this card. Hence, it is time to link the SFDC objects with this card. Click the \u201cAssociate\u201d link. The following screen entitled \u201cAssociate\u201d will appear on your screen. First, we need to choose a connection. Click the \u201cPlease select a connect\u201d dropdown. This will provide a list of available connections. Click the \u201cWalkthrough (test)\u201d connection and confirm it. Secondly, you must select a SFDC object. Please locate the \u201cPlease Select an Object Type\u201d dropdown and click on it. The dropdown will give you available object types for you to choose. I will choose \u201cOpportunity\u201d to demonstrate.
