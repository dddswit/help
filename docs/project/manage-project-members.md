 There are two ways to remove Members from a Project.

 The Master and Admin cannot be removed from a Project. In the case of a Private Project, the Host's ability to remove Members depends on their Permissions. For more information on Permissions Settings, see [Set Workspace Permissions](https://help.swit.io/feature/19021808473085p1BBi/1902260525213uEbops).
