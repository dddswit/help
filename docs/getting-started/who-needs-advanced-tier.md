# Who Needs Advanced Tier?

As mention earlier, SWIT is specifically created for larger teams (more than 50 employees) with cross-functional collaboration using multiple workspaces. Further, SWIT Advanced Tier is designed to help you get the most out of your team-working experience. With its special features, SWIT will transfer your team-working experience to a whole new level.

 3.1

*Need for Multi-Workspace Management*: In a company with 50 or more people, it is inconvenient to use only one workspace. Hence, multiple multi-workspaces (e.g., teams, departments) need to be created and utilized.

 3.2

*Easy Management by Providing a Certain Amount of Storage for the Company*: By purchasing the Advanced Tier, you can create a larger amount of dedicated workspace for your company. This allows you to manage the workspaces associated with your company in a more effective way. Remember this: With more storage, your team can do much more!
