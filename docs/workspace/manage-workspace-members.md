# Manage Workspace Members

Manage Workspace Members
========================

 Only the Master and Admin can manage Workspace Members. If your Permissions Settings allow you to manage Workspace Members, this means you can change certain Membersâ€™ roles or even remove Members from the Workspace.

   
A Swit Workspace consists of the following roles: Master, Admin, Host, Member and Guest.

 For a detailed description of Permissions for each role, see [Set Workspace Permissions](https://help.swit.io/feature/19021808473085p1BBi/1902260525213uEbops).
