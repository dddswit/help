Refund Policies
===============

 At Swit, our Refunds will be given back in the form of Swit Credits, which have many different uses for our users. You can use your Credits to pay for our Services, use Credits to pay for Upgrades (regardless if you have a Annual or Monthly Plan), and use Credits to pay for the next Months’/Years’ Services as well.

   
If users decide to cancel their Paid Plan(s) the refund will be in Credits, NOT in any other form. If you ever decide to come back and use Swit, you can use your unused Credits to purchase a paid Tier Plan.

 If the Super Admin of a Premium Workspace or the Master/Admin of a Standard Workspace decide to have a Workspace deleted, those Credits will be deleted as well. You will be notified with a Warning if you attempt to delete your Workspace for verification.

   
**Monthly-charged users:** They’ll get 100% prorated Refund for the remainder Dates/Credits that they don’t actually use.

   
**Annually-charged user:** They’ll get 100% prorated Refund for the remainder Months/Credits that they don’t actually use.

 Credits will appear back in your account within

**\_\_** hours/days. If not, please contact us at [help@swit.io](mailto:help@swit.io) .

 Credits will be used to pay for any Upgrades/Payments prior to your original Billing method. If you do not have enough Credits in your account, this will result in a negative balance which will be applied to your next payment. If at anytime you would like to make an advanced payment you can do so. Simply click on ‘Make a Payment’ button and procedee.
