# Managing Billing Details

 Here at Swit, we make it easy for you to manage your Billing details. We offer two types of Billing options. You can choose by Monthly or pick Annually, depending on your preference.

 In the Premium Tier, ONLY the Super Admin can manage Downgrades and view Billing information, for the Premium Tier, the Master and Admin (with Billing permissions) can view Billing information for the Standard Tier. To view additional information about “Billing”, go to your Workspace settings and click on Billing for more details. You will be able to see what plan you have, you can choose to Upgrade your plan, and see all the Features you can use on your plan.
