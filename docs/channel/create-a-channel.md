# Create a Channel

Create a Channel
================

 There are two kinds of Channels.  
  
**Public Channel**  
Members can participate in any Public Channel. All Public Channels can be found in Browse Channels.  
  
**Private Channel ![Build a new workspace](https://files.swit.io/help_image/GS_04_Private_icon.png)**  
Only invited Members can participate in a Private Channel, as it cannot be found through the [Browse Channels] list.

   
The permission to create Channels depends on the settings given to you. For more information, see [Set Workspace Permissions](https://help.swit.io/feature/19021808473085p1BBi/1902260525213uEbops).

* Enter the Channel name and purpose, then select Members to invite.

  [Create Channel] is not visible to Members who do not have the privilege of creating Channels.

 A Public Channel can be converted to a Private Channel through Settings. However, once a Channel is Private, you cannot change it back to Public. For more information, see [Make a Channel Private](https://help.swit.io/feature/19021808473085p1BBi/1902260525213uEbops).
