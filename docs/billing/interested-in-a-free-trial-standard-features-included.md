# Interested in a Free Trial (Standard Features included)?

 Anyone who is interested in using Swit will have to be a registered Member in order to try out our Free Trial. Our two week Free trial lets you use the Standard Tier with all the Standard Features included! After the two weeks are up, your Features will be unfortunately deactivated. You can still use Swit for FREE but without the Standard Features. If you decide to change your mind and Upgrade, you can keep on using these amazing Features for many years to come!

 After your two week Free Standard Trail, you can request to get another two weeks on us with valid reasons. If your request is accepted, Swit Inc will reinstate your account for another two weeks with all the Standard Features available for you to use once more!
