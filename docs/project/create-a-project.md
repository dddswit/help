Create a Project
================

 There are two kinds of Projects in Swit - Public Projects and Private Projects.

 ### Public Project

 You can join a Public Project at any time by searching through [Browse Projects]. Depending on your Permissions, you may or may not be able to create a new Project. For more information, see [Set Workspace Permissions](https://help.swit.io/feature/19021808473085p1BBi/1902260525213uEbops).
