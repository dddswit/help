# Project

  Can I change the Project View? You can toggle between 5 different Project Views: Status view, Bucket view, Team view, Timeline, and Calendar. Play around with them by clicking one of the options in the top bar of a Project, and find what best suits your needs!   What is a Backlog? A Backlog is a list of tasks that need to be completed in order for a Project to accomplish its goals. You can create tasks required for your Project in Backlog and move them to your sheets once you're ready.   Can I chat in a Project? You can chat in a Project by using Chat in the Side Tab. Open the Side Tab and select the Chat tab.   What is the Today's tab? The Today's function shows you all the tasks you have to do. You will only see the tasks for the day and the tasks that are past due which will help you keep up with your work. However, any tasks without a due date will not show up here, so make sure to check the My Tasks area.   What is the difference between Timeline and Workload? Timeline is a view that lets you see the overall schedule of a Project. It shows the date bar by task and allows you to adjust the duration according to the schedule. Workload can show you the schedule per member, so that you can see how much time a member has to complete a Project or task. Like Timeline, you can move the date bar to adjust the work period.
