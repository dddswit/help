                <h1 id="the-administration-feature">The “Administration” Feature</h1>
<p><strong>The “Administration” Feature</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how to effectively use the “Administration” feature, which lets you manage workspaces, members of your company, groups, billing, authentication, and settings. Please note that this is designed for Advanced Masters and Advanced Administrators. Hence, the “Administration” button does not appear to regular Swit members and prevents them from accessing sensitive information. </p>
<p>Locate the “Administration” button at the bottom left corner and click on it to proceed.</p>
<p>1.<strong><em>The Administration Screen</em>:</strong> Once you have clicked on the button, you will be directed to the “Administration” screen.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are multiple options you can choose from in the left sidebar. They are (1) Company Information Box, (2) Workspaces, (3) Members and Groups, (4) Billing, (5) Authentication, and (6) Settings.</p>
<p>1.1.<strong><em>Compnay Information Box</em></strong>: On the top of the left sidebar, you will be able to see your company’s information box. It consists of the (1) Name of the Advanced Dashboard and (2) its URL. If you want to change your company information, click on the box. You will be directed to the following view.</p>
<p>1.1.1.<strong><em> Changing Company Information</em></strong>: In this section, you can change your company information, such as company logo, company name, and company URL. Once you are finished making changes, click the “confirm” button. The browser will then be redirected back to the “Administration” screen.</p>
<p>1.2.<strong><em>Workspaces</em></strong>: In this section, Advanced Masters and Advanced Administrators can view all workspaces created in Advanced Dashboard.</p>
<p>The purpose of this section is for Advanced Masters or Advanced Administrators to see what kind of workspaces have been created by company members. You can see the following information in the body: (1) workspace logo, (2) workspace name, (3) workspace URL, (4) the master’s name of each workspace, (5) number of members in each workspace, (6) latest work date, (7) status, and (8) data usage.</p>
<p>1.2.1.<strong><em>Workspaces</em></strong>: This section displays the company logo, company name, and company URL for each workspace created in Advanced Dashboard. Click the “Workspaces” header to organize workspaces in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>1.2.2.</p>
<p><strong><em>Master</em></strong>: This section displays the name of each master in charge of his or her workspace. Click the “Master” header to sort the names in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>1.2.3.</p>
<p><strong><em>Members</em></strong>: This section lets you see the number of members in each workspace. Click the “Members” header to rearrange the box in numerical order from highest to lowest values or vice versa.</p>
<p>1.2.4.<strong><em>Latest Work Date</em></strong>: This section lets you see when each workspace was last used. Click the “Latest Work Date” header to rearrange the box in chronological order from the oldest to the newest date or vice versa. </p>
<p>1.2.5.</p>
<p><strong><em>Status</em></strong>: This section is designed to show you the status of each workspace: public or private. Here, Advanced Masters and Advanced Administrators can check the public or private status of the workspace. It should be noted that AM and AA do not have authority to change information in the workspace created by others (Only viewing is possible). Only the workspace Masters and Administrators can modify its information. AM and AA do not have authority to access private workspaces in which they do not participate. However, the authority to delete workspaces or access sensitive information, such as messages or work, is not given to them. </p>
<p>1.2.6.</p>
<p><strong><em>Data Usage</em></strong>: This section displays the data usage of each workspace. Here you can observe which workspace is using the most data. </p>
<p>1.2.7.</p>
<p><strong><em>Overviewing Members of Each Workspaces</em></strong>: Swit gives Advanced Masters and Administrators more control over their workspace experience, granting them the ability to view who works from which workspace. Click any workspace to view this information. I will choose the “Clark Sandbox” workspace to demonstrate.</p>
<p>As the following screenshot shows, information from the previous sections are displayed—i.e. 1.2.1–1.2.6: (1) workspace logo, (2) workspace name, (3) workspace URL, (4) the master’s name in each workspace, (5) number of members in each workspace, (6) latest work date, (7) status, and (8) data usage.</p>
<p>In addition, you can see who works for which workspace.</p>
<p><strong><em>Overviewing Master</em></strong>: To find out information about the master of the current workspace, click on the master’s name on the top of the box. </p>
<p>You will then be led to the following screen, where you can see information about the leader. In addition, as an Advanced Master or Administrator, you can deactivate the master’s account, reset the master’s password, and add the master to a group.</p>
<p>1.2.7.1.1.  This link allows you to deactivate the master’s account. Once the master is deactivated, he or she cannot access the dashboard until the account is reactivated. Carefully read the warning before confirming.</p>
<p>1.2.7.1.2.**</p>
<p><em>Send the Password Reset Email</em>**: This link allows you to reset the master’s password. </p>
<p>1.2.7.1.3.<strong><em>Add Groups</em></strong>: This link allows you to add the master to an existing group. Click the “Add Groups” link to proceed.</p>
<p>Clicking on the “Select Groups” box will display existing groups to choose from.</p>
<p>Selecting the group and confirming will add the master to the selected group.</p>
<p>2.7.2.<strong><em>Member Management</em></strong>: We will discuss this feature in “1.3</p>
<p><strong><em>Members and Groups</em></strong>”.  </p>
<p>2.8.<strong><em>Search Workspace</em></strong>: On the bottom of the screen, you can see a search bar with the placeholder, “Search Workspace”. The search bar allows you to find a specific workspace.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you want to find the workspace named “Get Swit Done.” Type “Get Swit Done” in the search bar and press enter. </p>
<p>The search bar will display the “Get Swit Done” workspace for you to manage.</p>
<p>1.2.9.<strong><em>Restricting Workspace Creator</em></strong>: There is a “Setting the permission for creating Workspaces” button on the top of the screen. This function restricts who can create workspaces. Click the button to manage the restrictions.</p>
<p>By default, all members are allowed to create Workspaces. If you want to set a restriction, please choose “Advanced Master, Advanced Admin” in the dropdown and confirm it.</p>
<p>1.3.<strong><em>Members and Groups</em></strong>: The purpose of this section is to allow the Advanced Master and Administrator to intuitively manage members. This section is grouped into three distinct but related categories: (1) Member Management, (2) Manage Invitations, and (3) Groups.</p>
<p>1.3.1.<strong><em>Member Management</em></strong>: The purpose of this section is for Advanced Masters or Advanced Administrators to oversee key information about his or her members. </p>
<p>You can see the following labels in the first bar: (1) Workspace, (2) Groups, (3) Roles, (4) Status, (5) SSO, (6) Password, and (8) Reset. Then, you can see the following labels in the header: (1) Users, (2) Roles, (3) Status, (4) Latest Update, (5) SSO, (6) Password, and (7) Data Usage. Let's talk about the labels in the first bar. </p>
<p><strong>Note: The SSO column is only exposed to the Advanced Dashboard using the SSO feature. In other words, it is not exposed to the space where the function is not used.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em> 1.3.1.1.</em></strong><strong><em>The First Bar</em></strong></p>
<p>1.3.1.1.1.<strong><em>Workspaces</em></strong>: This function allows you to see all members who belong to a specific workspace. Click on the “Workspaces” dropdown button to proceed.</p>
<p>Once you click on “Workspaces”, Swit will provide you a chart that contains all the existing workspaces in your Swit network. Here, you can pick and choose a workspace.</p>
<p>Let's say that you want to find out who works in the “Get Swit Done” workspace. Click the “Get Swit Done” checkbox.</p>
<p>Now the following screen will appear for you to manage.</p>
<p>Do you see the “(1)” indicator on the right side of “Workspaces”? This indicates that you have chosen only one workspace.   </p>
<p>Of course, if you choose two workspaces, the number would be “(2)”.</p>
<p>1.3.1.1.2.<strong><em>Group</em></strong>: This function allows you to see all members who are grouped in a specific group. Click on the “Groups” dropdown button to proceed.</p>
<p>Once you click the button, Swit will provide you a chart that contains all the existing groups in your Swit network. Here, you can pick and choose a workspace. I will choose the “Executive” checkbox to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Now a list of the executives in your Swit network will appear on your screen.</p>
<p>1.3.1.1.3.<strong><em>Roles</em></strong>: This function allows you to manage your members’ roles. Click on the “Roles” dropdown button to proceed.</p>
<p>Once you click the button, Swit will provide you a chart that contains three options: (1) Advanced Master, (2) Advanced Admin, and (3) Manage Members. Here, you can pick and choose a role. </p>
<p>I will choose the “Advanced Admin” checkbox.</p>
<p>Now a list of Advanced Administrators in your Swit network will appear on your screen for you to manage.</p>
<p>1.3.1.1.4.<strong><em>Status</em></strong>: This function allows you to manage your members’ status. Click on the “Status” dropdown button to proceed.</p>
<p>Once you click the button, Swit will provide you a box that contains two options: (1) Active and (2) Inactive. Here, you can pick and choose a status.</p>
<p>I will choose the “Inactive” box.</p>
<p>Now a list of inactive members in your Swit network will appear.</p>
<p>1.3.1.1.5.<strong><em>SSO</em></strong>: This function allows you to manage your members’ SSO status. Click on the “SSO” dropdown button to proceed.</p>
<p>Once you click the button, Swit will provide you a box that contains two options: (1) Connect and (2) Disconnect. Here, you can pick and choose a SSO.</p>
<p>I will choose the “Disconnect” option.</p>
<p>Now a list of disconnected members in your Swit network will appear on your screen for you to manage.</p>
<p>1.3.1.1.6.<strong><em>Password</em></strong>: This function allows you to manage your members’ password status. Click on the “Password” dropdown button to proceed.</p>
<p>Once you click the button, Swit will show you a box that contains two options: (1) Registered and (2) Unregistered. Here, you can pick and choose a password status. </p>
<p>I will choose the “Register” option. </p>
<p>Now a list of those who use SAML authentication will appear on your screen for you to manage.</p>
<p>1.3.1.1.7.<strong><em>Reset</em></strong>: This function allows you to set the “Member Management” section to the factory default.</p>
<p>1.3.1.2.<strong><em>The Second Bar</em></strong>: This bar provides the sorting function.</p>
<p>1.3.1.2.1.<strong><em>Users</em></strong>: This function visually organizes the name of members in your Swit network in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>1.3.1.2.2.<strong><em>Latest Update</em></strong>: This function visually organizes the members’ activity status in chronological order from oldest to the newest or vice versa.</p>
<p>1.3.1.2.3.<strong><em>Date Usage</em></strong>: This function allows you to check who is using the most data at given time. By viewing this information, you can appropriately manage the space for your company. The person with the most data usage is shown at the top of the list, followed by the person with less usage, in decreasing order.</p>
<p>1.3.1.3.<strong><em>Export the Team Member Data</em></strong>: On the top of the screen, you can see the “Export the Team Member Date” button. Click the button to export the team member data as an excel file. </p>
<p>1.3.1.4.<strong><em>Invite New Members</em></strong>: One the top of the screen, there is another function called, “Invite New Members.” This function is the exact same as “1.3.2</p>
<p><strong><em>Manage Invitation</em></strong>”</p>
<p>1.3.2.</p>
<p><strong><em>Manage Invitation</em></strong>: The purpose of this section is to help you manage invitations. There are three branches under the “Manage Invitation” section—i.e. “Invite Members,” “Inviting,” and “Invitation History.”</p>
<p>1.3.2.1.<strong><em>Invite Members</em></strong>: This function lets you invite members into a specific group. Yet, if you are connected by SSO, the following sign will appear on your screen: “* You can't invite members when SSO (single sign-on) is connected.” Please disable your SSO to use the “Invite Members” function. We will deal with how to disable SSO in “1.5</p>
<p><strong><em>Authentication</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>Once you disabled the SSO function, “1.3.2.1</p>
<p><strong><em>Invite Members</em></strong>” will be displayed as below.</p>
<p>1.3.2.1.1.<strong><em>Email Box</em></strong>: Please enter the email address of the person you would like to invite. You can add many at once.</p>
<p>1.3.2.1.2.<strong><em> Roles</em></strong>: You can assign the roles for the Members invited in advance: (1) Advanced Admin or (2) Advanced Member.</p>
<p>1.3.2.1.3.<strong><em>Groups</em></strong>: You can assign the groups for the Members invited in advance.</p>
<p>Please click the “Add Groups” box to see the existing groups in your Swit network. </p>
<p>When you make a selection, your invitation is ready to be sent.</p>
<p>1.3.2.1.4.<strong><em>CSV</em></strong>: Swit allows you to invite members by a CSV file. If you want to use this function, please click “Invite Members by CSV” link. </p>
<p>The link will lead you to the follow screen: </p>
<p>Follow the step-by-step guide to use this fuction. </p>
<p>1.3.2.2.Invitation Sent: This feature is a real-time invitation tracker that gives you a way to quickly view the status of an invitation to a member. Upon sending an invitation to a member, you will see the tracker appear in this section, informing (1) the invitor, (2) the invitee, and (3) the invitation timestamp. When the invitee accepts the invitation, the tracker no longer appears in this section.</p>
<p>1.3.2.3.Invitation Accepted: When the invitee accepts the invitation, the tracker notifies the invitation sender that the invitee is successfully linked by providing the date accepted information.</p>
<p>1.3.3.</p>
<p><strong><em>Groups</em></strong>: The “Group” function in the Workspace is different from the “Group” function in the Administration. Concerning the “Group” function in the Administration, Advanced Masters and Advanced Administrators can create groups and add members from Dashboard to the group. This feature is mainly used for the purpose of promoting organization within a team. Concerning the “Group” function in the Workspace, workspace Masters and Administrators can create groups within the workspace. They can also add members to the created group. In addition, they can mention team members on a group basis or invite them to channels and projects.</p>
<p>The middle section of the screen will display (1) Create Groups, (2) Group name and (3) the number of members in each group.</p>
<p>1.3.3.1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Create Groups</em></strong>: In this section, you can create a new group. When you click the “Create Groups” link, the “Create Group” page will appear. Here, you can name groups and add group descriptions.</p>
<p>I will create the “AAA” group to demonstrate. </p>
<p>Once a group is created, the newly created group will appear on the “Groups” section:</p>
<p>1.3.3.2.</p>
<p><strong><em> Add Members</em></strong>: Click the checkbox next to the “AAA” group in order to add a member.</p>
<p>Once you have clicked the checkbox, a new box will appear beneath the “Groups” header. It will display how many groups have been selected and a “Edit” dropdown button.</p>
<p>Please click the “Edit” dropdown button and then click the “Add Members to the Groups” link. The following box will appear on your screen. In the space provided, type the name of the member that you would like to invite. </p>
<p>The member that you have chosen is then added to the group. However, there is a hidden feature in this section. Bringing the cursor on the right of the numerical indicator displays how many members are in the group. Swit will display an icon with three dots. Clicking the icon will give you four options: (1) View the Members, (2) Add the Members to the Group, (3) Modify the Group, and (4) Delete the Group. </p>
<p>1.3.3.2.1.<strong><em>View the Members</em></strong>: This section allows you to view who is in the group, along with his or her email address.</p>
<p>1.3.3.2.2.<strong><em>Add the Members to the Group</em></strong>: You can add more members in this section. Please type the name of the members that you desire to add in the group.</p>
<p>1.3.3.2.3.<strong><em>Modify the Group</em></strong>: Here, you can change the group name along with the group description.</p>
<p>1.3.3.2.4.<strong><em>Delete the Group</em></strong>: This section lets you delete the group. Please note that once you choose to delete the group, all information will be lost and you can’t undo this action.</p>
<p>1.4.<strong><em>Authentication</em></strong>: You can control how your team members sign in. Two options will be given to you under the “Authentication Management” section: (1) “Members Sign in with an Account and Password Created in Swit,” (2) “Members Sign in Using SALM.” By default, the “Authentication Management” is set to option 1 unless you specify otherwise.  </p>
<p>1.4.1.**<em>The First Option</em>:</p>
<p><strong>This is a traditional log-in method, which requires a username and password to log in. If you choose this option</strong>,</p>
<p>**your members must have a Swit account to log in.</p>
<p>1.4.2.<strong><em>The Second Option</em></strong>: This section allows your team members to use their own identity provider (i.e. G Suite or MS Azure) for logging in to Swit. In this case, Swit does not function as an Identity Provider. If you choose this option, your team members do not need to have a Swit username and password. </p>
<p>This section will provide you with five inputs: (1) SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP), (2) Identity Provider Issuer, (3) Public Certificate, (4) Authentication range setting, and (5) Custom (optional). Please follow the steps below to set up SSO (Single sign-on). </p>
<p>1.4.2.1.<strong><em>SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)</em></strong>: Please enter your SMAL 2.0 Endpoint. This is where you go when you try to login.</p>
<p>1.4.2.2.<strong><em>Identity Provider Issuer</em></strong>: Please type the name of your Identity Provider (i.e. G Suite or MS Azure). </p>
<p>1.4.2.3.<strong><em>Public Certificate</em></strong>: This is where you enter your Identity Provider x.509 Certificate.</p>
<p>1.4.2.4.<strong><em>Authentication Range Setting</em></strong>: The members have to use the following authentication methods in the Swit Technologies Inc space: (1) “All member sign in through SSO”, (2) “Sign in using either the ‘Normal’ or ‘SSO’, depending on Member selection.” Please choose one that most fits your needs.</p>
<p>1.4.2.5.<strong><em>Custom (Optional)</em></strong>: Here, you can add a SSO login screen image.</p>
<p>1.4.2.6.Once the setup has been completed, emails will be sent out to all members.</p>
<p>1.5.<strong><em>Setting</em></strong>: This section allows you to control setting information for Sign Up mode. Here, you can choose whether (1) only those invited to Swit Technologies Inc Dashboard by invitation can be joined or (2) both those invited and those who have specific domain address form can be joined. By default, the “Setting for Sign Up Mode” is set to “Allowing only those who have been sent an invitation” unless you specify otherwise. Please choose one that most fits your needs.</p>
<p>1.6.<strong><em>Billing</em></strong>: There are five branches under the “Billing” section: (1) Overview, (2) Payment Details, (3) Payment Method, (4) Billing Address, and (5) Payment Contact.</p>
<p>1.6.1.<strong><em>Overview</em></strong>: This section gives you the following information: (1) what version of Swit you are currently using, (2) what type of payment plan you are in, (3) how many members are under your charge, (4) how much your estimated monthly bill would be, and (5) where to cancel the free trial.</p>

<p>If you are using the “Advanced Plus (1 TB)” version, Swit will give you an option to downgrade to Advanced. If you are using the “Advanced (20 GB)” version, Swit will give you an option to upgrade to Advanced Plus. </p>
<p>Let’s say that you want to downgrade to Advanced. Click the “Downgrade to Advanced” button on the screen. You will get the following warning: “Impact of Downgrade.”</p>
<p><strong>Please note that a reduction in storage capacity may result in data loss, which begins from the oldest data to the newest data</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you are ready to downgrade, click the “Continue” button. The step-by-step downgrading process will appear on your screen as follows: (1) Downgrade, (2) Review Your Choices, and (3) Confirm Billing Information. </p>

<p>In you choose the “Flexible Plan,” you only pay the daily calculated cost for the number of active Members per month. Members can be added or removed at any time. The “Annual Plan,” on the other hand, is a one-year commitment at</p>
<p><em>a discounted price</em>. You will be billed monthly for the agreed number of Seats. You will be able to add Seats at any time during your one-year commitment period. However, you will not be able to remove Seats. </p>
<p>Please click the “Change Plan” link to proceed. The step-by-step process of changing plan will appear on your screen as follows: (1) Change Plan, (2) Review Your Choices, and (3) Confirm Billing Information.</p>
<p>1.6.1.2.1.<strong><em>Change Plan</em></strong>: Please make sure you understand what is entailed by changing your plan. When you are ready to proceed, please click the “Continue” button.</p>
