<p>5.3 Getting to know the My Workspace Page</p>
<p>The Workspace page is sort of like Grand Central Station for core services. This page contains a variety of elements, which can be categorized as follows: (1) the Features in the Left Sidebar—Integrated Search, Workspace List, All Activities, and All Mentions and (2) the Features on the middle section—Build a New Workspace.</p>
<p>SWIT has kept the site fairly simple, which is a major part of its appeal. In helping its users focus on their tasks, SWIT has keep the pages free from distractions and made them easy to follow. As you will see below, some of the most notable features of our Workspace is that Workplace lets you see and search the activities and mentions of all the workplaces you participate in by displaying them in one place. Since Cross-Workplace chronologically presents the list of all the activities and mentions that you have missed in an organized, clean, and readable way, you can manage your activities and mentions from a single dashboard! (Workspace features can be added to the existing workspace home structure.)</p>
<p>5.3.1</p>
<p><em>The Feature in the Middle Section</em>: Build a New Workspace</p>
<p>The Middle Section—Workspace List—is grouped into two categories: (1) My Workspace and (2) Browse Workspace. However, in order to use these features, you first need to build a workspace!</p>
<p>5.3.1.1 How to Build a Workspace</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.1</p>
<p><em>Where to Begin</em>: By clicking the Build a New Workspace Button, you can begin the process.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.2</p>
<p><em>Getting Started</em>: You will be directed to the Build a Workspace Your Team Will Love section, where you will be asked several questions, such as (1) Workspace Name, (2) Your Workspace URL, (3) Public Workspace, and (4) Bring the Group Information.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.2.1</p>
<p><em>Workspace Name</em>: Type your Workspace name.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.2.2</p>
<p><em>Your Workspace URL</em>: Put your Workspace URL in the space.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.2.3</p>
<p><em>Public Workspace</em>: This feature lets you choose whether or not you want your workspace to be detectable by other members of your company. You can control this simply by clicking Private Workspace button.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.2.4</p>
<p><em>Public Mode</em>: If you choose public mode, your workspace will be exposed at Browse Workspaces. Since a Workspace created through this mode is visible to your coworkers on your SWIT network, other members can see and freely join it.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.2.5</p>
<p><em>Private Mode</em>: On the other hand, if you choose private mode by turning on the Private Workspace button, your workspace will not be exposed to anyone. If you want to prevent anyone else but you from accessing your workspace, please select this mode. If you want to invite certain members to your workspace, send them an invitation email. Those who already have Advanced Dashboard can join your workspace through the invitation sent by you. Once invitees accept the invitation, your workspace will appear on their My Workspace screen.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.3</p>
<p><em>Bring the Group Information</em>: When you invite a member, you can import the information of the group to which the invited member belongs. This can be done simply by clicking the Bring the group information button. It is pretty amazing, isn’t it? </p>
<p>5.3.1.1.4</p>
<p><em>Next Stage</em>: When you click the Next Button to proceed, SWIT takes you to the next phase.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.5</p>
<p><em>Importing Data</em>: On the next page, you will be asked whether you want to import any data you have already worked on in other platforms, such as Slack, Trello, and Asana. If you don’t have data to import, please click the Skip button.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.6</p>
<p><em>My Workspace</em>: Congratulations! Now, your Workspace is created!</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.7</p>
<p><em>Go to Main Page</em>: Please, click the button on the top of the left corner to go to the main page of your Workspace.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1.8</p>
<p><em>Welcome</em>: Welcome to the main page! </p>
<p>5.3.1.2</p>
<p><em>Workspace List</em>: Workspace List consists of two components: (1) My Workspace and (2) Browse Workspace. </p>
<p>5.3.1.2.1</p>
<p><em>My Workspace</em>: My Workspace shows a list of the workspaces you are currently participating in. You can see the following information in this section: (1) Workspace Photo, (2) Workspace Name, (3) Workspace URL, (4) Your role in Workspace, (5) Workspace setting button (visible only for Workspace Master, Administrator), and (6) Workspace Exit button.</p>

<p>5.3.2.1 </p>
<p><em>Integrated Search</em>: Integrated Search is a powerful search engine that allows you to perform very specific searches. There are five branches under Integrated Search, which help you find what you are looking for more precisely. Our Integrated Search is fast and intuitive, so you never miss a word!</p>
<p>5.3.2.2</p>
<p><em>Typing in the Space</em>: When you click Integrate Search, the following screen will appear. Type in the space what you are looking for. Then, hit the enter key.</p>
<p>5.3.2.3</p>
<p><em>Search Results</em>: Search results will appear in the following list: (1) All, (2) Channels &amp; Projects, (3) Chatting &amp; Ideas, (4) Task Cards, and (5) Files.</p>
<p>5.3.2.3.1</p>
<p><em>All</em>: This section provides search results from all workspaces you are currently participating in. This feature will help you quickly access what you wish to find.</p>
<p>5.3.2.3.2</p>
<p><em>Channels &amp; Projects</em>: This section provides the name of the channel and project you are participating in.</p>
<p>5.3.2.3.3</p>

<p>5.3.2.3.4</p>
<p><em>Task Cards</em>: This section provides Job Title, Details of the Project, and Comments.</p>
<p>5.3.2.3.5</p>
<p><em>Files</em>: This section provides search results from files you have uploaded and files uploaded to channels or projects you participate in. </p>
<p>5.3.2.4 </p>
<p><em>All Activities</em>: All Activities tracks the ongoing status updates of your coworkers. When your team members have new activities, SWIT sends a notification to you. A red dot will be displayed in the All Activities tab if there is any activity that you missed. If you click on the tab, all the activities—i.e., what your coworkers are doing and what they are up to on SWIT—come together on a scrollable page.</p>
<p>On the page, the following information will be shown without text restriction: (1) Activity Content, (2) Activity Time, and (3) Workspace Information (pictures, names). Now, you will never miss anything that happens in the SWIT community! Keep track of your coworkers’ activities, while they keep track of yours!</p>
<p>5.3.2.4.1 </p>
<p><em>All Activities Bar</em>: When you click All Activities, the All Activities bar will appear on the top of the screen. There, you can see the following options: (1) Refresh, (2) Mark All as Read, and (3) Settings buttons.</p>
<p>5.3.2.4.1.1</p>
<p><em>Refresh</em>: The information you see listed on the All Activities section is always changing based on the activities of your coworkers. Hence, be sure to refresh your pages often!</p>
<p>5.3.2.4.1.2</p>
<p><em>Mark All as Read</em>: To mark all activities as read without opening the activities, click Mark All as Read.</p>
<p>5.3.2.4.1.3</p>
<p><em>Settings:</em> By default, the Activity Settings are set to their maximum levels unless you specify otherwise. This means that your Activity Settings are set for you to see all kinds of activities in your SWIT network. Yet, in this section, you can set the Activity Notifications you want to receive. </p>
<p><em>5.3.2.5</em></p>
<p><em>All Mentions</em>: When your team members mention you, SWIT sends a notification out to your All Mentions section. A red dot will be displayed in the All Mentions tab if there is any mention of you that you missed. If you click on the tab, the following information will be shown with a maximum of two lines of text due to space considerations: (1) the name of the member who mentioned you, (2) the time when you were mentioned, (3) the reason for the mention, (4) the workspace name, and (5) the project name. This feature will allow you to easily follow your tasks by turning all the mentions of you into trackable tasks!</p>
<p>5.3.2.5.1</p>
<p><em>All Mentions Bar</em>: When you click All Mentions, the All Mentions bar will appear on the top of the screen. There, you can see the following buttons: (1) Refresh and (2) Settings.</p>
<p>5.3.2.5.1.1</p>
<p><em>Refresh</em>: The information you see listed on the All Mentions section is always changing based on the activities of your coworkers. Hence, be sure to refresh your pages often to get the freshest mentions of you!</p>
