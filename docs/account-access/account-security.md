# Account Security

 If you have reason to be concerned about the security of your account, donâ€™t worry! To ensure your account information is secure, simply sign out of any sessions currently open.

 If you have forgotten to log out of a public computer or you have lost your mobile phone, you can log out of all unattended sessions except the one that you are currently in.
