# Create a Project

 Planning your Projects from start to finish shouldn’t be a hassle. With Swit, spend less time delegating and more time doing. You’ve got this!

   
Click the ![Proejct tool bar](https://files.swit.io/help_image/GS_04_Create_icon.png)plus icon and click [Create Project]. Create the Project name and purpose (i.e. Product Launch in July). Setting a purpose is very helpful in getting everyone on the same page about the Project. Select the Member(s) you would like to invite and press confirm. Congratulations, your first Project is created!
