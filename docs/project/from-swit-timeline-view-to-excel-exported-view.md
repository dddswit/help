# From Swit Timeline View to Excel Exported View

**From Swit Timeline View to Excel Exported View** 

 The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how to export and print out the Gantt chart (i.e., Timeline View) of the Project Box. As you will see below (Figure 1), the original Swit version of the timeline and the exported Excel version match each other perfectly. Guess what? This innovative feature is available in ALL Tiers and can be used by anyone who is involved in the project. Let’s get started!



**Figure 1. From the Gantt Chart to the Excel File**

 The following screenshot demonstrates a bird's-eye view of the Swit timeline.



**Figure 2. Swit Timeline**

 Notice that there are arrows at both ends of the timeline view (Figure 2). They indicate the range of documents that can be output into an Excel file.

  When you are ready to export and print out the Project Box’s Gantt chart,

 locate the “EXPORT” function in the upper right corner and click on it. When the Export button 

 is clicked, an Excel file containing two (Timeline / Workload) tabs is displayed. The file will be 

 downloaded to your computer.

 The following screenshot illustrates a bird's-eye view of the exported Excel of the Swit timeline.

 Now let’s compare the original Swit version of the timeline and that of the exported Excel.

 As you can see, they match each other perfectly! Now let me show you the original Swit version of the workload. 



**Figure 9. The Original Swit Version of the Workload**

 The following screenshot demonstrates the Swit Workload’s exported Excel.

 It is time to compare the original to the exported Excel. As you will see below, they match each other perfectly!

 Swit now allows you to export and print out the Project Box’s Gantt chart (Timeline View). By doing so, you can manage your team's work dependency and be more efficient!
