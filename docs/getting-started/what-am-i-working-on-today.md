 Check Out Today's Work
----------------------

 Check out all of today's tasks in the Today Right Panel. This will help you visualize and anticipate today's workflow.

 ### Order of Work

 Once you've taken stock of what you have to do today, it's time to prioritize. Start with the Tasks you need to finish first, taking into account the Priority and Due Dates displayed on the Task Cards.

 To view Tasks that have passed their Due Date, click [only show overdue card] in the Today Right Panel.

 Plan long-term work
-------------------

 ### Timeline

 Although daily work is important, long-term planning is necessary to keep a Project on track. See a Project's progress in Timeline.  
In Timeline, you can hover over a TaskBar to manage the Taskâ€™s Checklist or move the bar to change the work schedule. To view Member-specific Task schedules, use Workload.
