# Pay by Credit card or pay by Invoice

 Here at Swit we allow you to pay by Credit Card or by Invoice, itâ€™s the best of both worlds! Paying by credit card might be the fastest way to pay but if you are eligible you can choose to receive invoices.

 ### Credit Card:

 The Master of the Workspace or the person responsible for paying for this service will be the only one who can change and update the Billing information.

 ### Invoice:

 Each month you will receive a report on the analytics of your usage, which only the Master or Admin (with Billing permissions) can access. With this report, you will be able to see your teams activity at a glance.

   
This is one of the best ways to improve efficiency and teamwork by being able to see how well your teams are doing, or if you might need to switch things up a bit from time to time.

 For plans on an annual payment schedule with at least 25 registered users, we can also provide you with an invoice payable by check or bank transfer.To see additional information about Invoices and if you qualify to receive them, click here for those details!
