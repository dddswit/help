# Adding New Registered Members (number of registered users)

 Being able to expand your team and keep it growing is the whole point of using a collaborative software like Swit. We want to see you grow and expand as far as possible.

   
 We only charge you for the number of registered (Active) users. Inactive Members can be Refunded after 24 hours of Inactivity. Adding new Members will be possible regardless if you are a Monthly-charged user or a Annually-charged user, but there will be some slight differences.

   
 ### Monthly-charged users:

 You can remove Members anytime out of your Workspace. You will get prorated refund for the remainder dates with a credit or money. When adding a Member, you will receive an Invoice, immediate payment is not required.

   
 ### Annually-charged users:

 You can remove Members anytime out of your Workspace. When a member is deleted, the number of unused days by the user will be calculated and refunded. When adding a Member, you will receive an Invoice, immediate payment is not required.

 Unused days

* Number of deleted users

* Price of annually discounted tier per day
