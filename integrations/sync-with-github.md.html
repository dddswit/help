<p>
 The GitHub integration supports synchronous connections between your GitHub account and Swit workspace. This enables automatic creation of reports or task cards in a Swit workspace from each new event in a GitHub repository, and the other way around as well.
</p>
<h2>
 Actions, the basic unit of GitHub integration
</h2>
<p>
 Each single workflow established between Swit and GitHub is called an "action." The action is basically a pair of a
 <strong>
  triggering
 </strong>
 and a
 <strong>
  triggered
 </strong>
 event, for example,
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Triggering:
  </strong>
  When an issue is opened in a particular
  <strong>
   GitHub
  </strong>
  repository
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Triggered:
  </strong>
  A notification message is created in a particular
  <strong>
   Swit
  </strong>
  channel
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 The screen below shows some of the different actions available. Using a collection of these actions, you can build a fully interactive, instant, bidirectional synchronization between the two services.

<h2>
 Get started
</h2>
<p>
 You can start using the GitHub integration by adding an action.
</p>
<h5>
 Different approaches to adding an action
</h5>
<p>
 For user convenience, actions can be added from various access points:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Add an action from Store:
   </strong>
   In Swit Store's left menu, select
   <strong>
    GitHub
   </strong>
   &gt;
   <strong>
    Manage Actions
   </strong>
   , then click on
   <strong>
    Add action
   </strong>
   in the body section.
  </p>
  <div class="block-image">
   <img alt="Add action from Store" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-add-action-from-store.png"/>
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Add an action from a channel/project:
   </strong>
   In a channel or project, click on
   <img alt="GitHub icon" class="icon" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-icon-git.svg"/>
   in the top-right corner, then click on
   <strong>
    Add action
   </strong>
   in the next page. In this case, the selectable actions are limited to those relevant to the particular channel or project you are in.
  </p>
  <div class="block-image">
   <img alt="Add action from channel" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-add-action-from-channel.png"/>
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Add an action from a task card:
   </strong>
   In a task card, find the GitHub box in the bottom-right corner, then click on
   <strong>
    Link
   </strong>
   in it. In this case, the selectable actions are limited to those relevant to the task.
  </p>
  <div class="block-image">
   <img alt="Add action from task" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-add-action-from-task.png"/>
  </div>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Because you have not yet authorized access to your GitHub account from the workspace, you will be asked to connect a GitHub account.
</p>
<h5>
 Authorize with a GitHub account
</h5>
<p>
 When prompted to authorize with your GitHub account, follow the steps below:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   Click
   <strong>
    Connect
   </strong>
   to proceed.
  </p>
  <div class="block-image">
   <img alt="Asked to connect GitHub" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-asked-to-connect-gitHub.png" width="400px"/>
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   You will be directed to the authorization page. Authorize access from your Swit account.
  </p>
  <div class="block-image">
   <img alt="Authorizing Swit Github Integration" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-authorizing-swit-github-integration.png" width="500px"/>
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If you need multiple GitHub accounts connected, try adding an action once again as guided in previous subsection until the following screen appears, then select
   <strong>
    Use another account
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <div class="block-image">
   <img alt="Choosing a Github account" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-choosing-a-github-account.png" width="550px"/>
  </div>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 Once successfully authorized, you are ready to add an action to sync with a GitHub repository.
</p>
<h2>
 Add actions in a channel
</h2>
<p>
 The actions provided for Swit channels are to notify the channel members of each relevant event occurring in a GitHub repository, including:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Issues opened
 </li>
 <li>
  Issues closed
 </li>
 <li>
  Commits pushed
 </li>
 <li>
  Pull requests opened
 </li>
 <li>
  Pull requests merged
 </li>
 <li>
  Pages created
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 These event notifications can be either as
 <strong>
  chat messages
 </strong>
 or
 <strong>
  idea posts
 </strong>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Follow the steps below to add an action in a channel. Although we here take one example action, all channel-targeted actions can be established almost in the same way.
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   Start adding an action in either way below:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    In Swit Store, select
    <strong>
     GitHub
    </strong>
    under the
    <strong>
     Manage Apps
    </strong>
    heading, then click on
    <strong>
     Add an action
    </strong>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    In the channel page, click on
    <img alt="GitHub icon" class="icon" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-icon-git.svg"/>
    in the top-right corner, then click on
    <strong>
     Add an action
    </strong>
    .
   </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="tip-box">
   <p>
    If GitHub access is not yet authorized, you will be asked for it first. See
    <i>
     "Authorize with a GitHub account"
    </i>
    .

  </div>
 </li>

 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   To test the action, perform the relevant event. For example, if you have added an action triggered by a new issue opened, open a new issue in the synced GitHub repository.
  </p>
  <div class="block-image">

<h2>
 Add actions in a project
</h2>
<p>
 The actions available in projects are mainly focused on synchronizing the creation and completion of Swit task cards and GitHub issues or pull requests in a
 <strong>
  bidirectional
 </strong>
 way. For example, an issue opened in a GitHub repository can trigger a task card to be created in a Swit project; or conversely, when a task is marked Done, the linked issue can synchronously be closed.
</p>
<p>
 This way, you can interact with your GitHub collaborators while staying within the Swit workspace.
</p>

 Follow the steps below to add an action in a project. Although we here take one example action, all project-targeted actions can be established almost in the same way.

   If successful, you will be directed where you can view all actions you have added (See Section

 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   To test the action, perform the triggering event and check for a synchronous occurrence of the counterpart event. If you have selected "When an issue is opened in
   <strong>
    repository
   </strong>
   , create a task card linked with it in
   <strong>
    project
   </strong>
   ," for example, open an issue in the selected GitHub repository and see if a corresponding tack card has been created in the Swit project.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     An issue opened in the GitHub repository:
    </p>
    <div class="block-image">
     <img alt="Project sync - GitHub side" src="https://pdn.swit.io/docs/help/github-project-sync-git-side.png"/>

    </div>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="tip-box">
   <p>
    Some actions work in the opposite direction, i.e., an event in the Swit project triggers its corresponding event in GitHub repository. In that case, test the action by performing the event on the Swit project side and check for the synchronous event in the GitHub repository.
   </p>
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Whether a Swit task is created in sync with a GitHub issue or pull request, or it happens the other way around, the task will be attached with a direct link to the GitHub counterpart. This link is used for synchronous completion of the task and issue/pull request, and also helps task followers conveniently visit and view the GitHub article.
