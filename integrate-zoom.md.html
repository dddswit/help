<h2>
 Using the Zoom App on Swit
</h2>
<p>
 Swit allows hosting Zoom meetings in four different places:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Right panel
 </li>
 <li>
  Channel box &gt; Chatroom
 </li>
 <li>
  Channel box &gt; Idea forum
 </li>
 <li>
  Project box &gt; Task card
 </li>
</ul>
<h5>
 Use in the right panel
</h5>
<p>
 The main Zoom UI is provided on the right panel.
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Basic in the right panel" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom3.png"/>
</div>
<p>
 The right panel offers the following controls:
</p>
<h3>
 Meetings/Webinars dropdown
</h3>
<p>
 Swit's Zoom integration supports managing both meetings and webinars. This dropdown is to select the type of Zoom event you'd like to manage.
</p>
<div class="tip-box">
 <p>
  Webinars can't be created within Swit.
 </p>
</div>
<h3>
 Host Now
</h3>
<p>
 This enables one-click hosting of a Zoom meeting by creating an instant Zoom meeting with default settings. The meeting is scheduled at the current time, and by sharing it, you can have workspace members join the meeting immediately.
</p>
<h3>
 Schedule Meeting
</h3>
<p>
 This control is used to host a fully user-customized meeting, especially including when to start and end the meeting. The specifiable settings include topic, date and time, time zone, and duration of the meeting.
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Schedule Meeting dialog box" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom15.png"/>
</div>
<h3>
 List of upcoming meetings
</h3>
<p>
 This section shows upcoming meetings you have scheduled ahead. Each meeting entry displays basic information about the meeting and provides several controls:
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Meeting entry in the right panel" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom17.png"/>
</div>
<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Start:
  </strong>
  Launches the scheduled meeting. This will redirect you to the Zoom meeting page.
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Copy invitation:
  </strong>
  Copies the meeting invitation text to the clipboard. You can paste it into an email or anywhere else you would like to send it out.
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Remove:
   </strong>
   Deletes the meeting from your Zoom account.
  </p>
  <div class="tip-box">
   <p>
    The recoverability of a deleted meeting/webinar depends on Zoom's policy. As of June 2020,
    <strong>
     meetings
    </strong>
    can be recovered within 7 days of deleting them, while
    <strong>
     webinars
    </strong>
    are permanently deleted immediately and thus unrecoverable.
   </p>
  </div>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 You can drag and drop this entry onto a Swit chat room or direct message to share it as an invitation for the channel members.
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Basic in the right panel" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom4.png"/>
</div>
<h5>
 Use in a channel
</h5>
<p>
 The channel provides some essential Zoom controls both in the chat room (and direct messages) and idea forum. In either space, click on + to open the menu, then select
 <strong>
  Zoom
 </strong>
 , and you will be given the following three items:
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Zoom menu in the channel" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom11.png"/>
</div>
<h3>
 Host meeting now &amp; Schedule meeting
</h3>
<p>
 These two controls work almost the same way as
 <strong>
  Host Now
 </strong>
 and
 <strong>
  Schedule Meeting
 </strong>
 , respectively, in the right panel. The only difference is that they automatically leave an invitation for the newly created meeting entry in the channel.
</p>
<h3>
 Share scheduled meeting
</h3>
<p>
 This enables you to share any previously scheduled upcoming meeting in the channel. Click this to open the following dialog box and select the scheduled meeting or webinar you want to share, then click
 <strong>
  Confirm
 </strong>
 .
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Share Scheduled Meeting" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom10.png"/>
</div>
<p>
 Although they provide the same Zoom features, the chat room and idea forum display invitations in significantly different formats:
</p>
<h3>
 Meetings shared in the chat room
</h3>
<p>
 In the chat room, members can join the meeting simply by clicking on the
 <strong>
  Join
 </strong>
 button.
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Invitation in the chat room" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom18.png"/>
</div>
<h3>
 Meetings shared in the idea forum
</h3>
<p>
 Instead of giving a
 <strong>
  Join
 </strong>
 control, the idea forum posts a full text of the invitation, including the meeting URL, ID, and password.
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Invitation in the idea forum" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom13.png"/>
</div>
<h5>
 Use in a task page
</h5>
<p>
 The task page provides a Zoom extension in the right bottom corner, allowing you to share invitations to relevant meetings. It supports similar Zoom features to those of the channel.
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Basic in the task page" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom1.png"/>
</div>
<h3>
 Host Now &amp; Schedule Meeting
</h3>
<p>
 These two controls work almost the same way as
 <strong>
  Host Now
 </strong>
 and
 <strong>
  Schedule Meeting
 </strong>
 , respectively, in the right panel. The only difference is that they automatically leave an invitation for the newly created meeting entry in the task card.
</p>
<h3>
 Link
</h3>
<p>
 This enables you to share any previously scheduled upcoming meeting in the task card. Click this to open the following dialog box and select the scheduled meeting or webinar you want to share.
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Link dialog box" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom8.png"/>
</div>
<h3>
 List of linked meetings
</h3>
<p>
 This section shows upcoming meetings linked with the task. Each meeting entry displays basic information about the meeting and provides several controls:
</p>
<div class="block-image">
 <img alt="Meeting entry in the right panel" src="https://dddswit.github.io/help/integrations/img/zoom19.png"/>
</div>
<ul>
