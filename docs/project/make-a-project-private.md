# Make a Project Private

Make a Project Private
======================

 Make a Project Private if you prefer to keep its Tasks confidential. You can also convert a Project that is already in use to a Private Project. Existing data and Members are retained.  
A Private Project canâ€™t be found in the Project List, but only through invitation from an existing Member.

 You cannot convert a Private Project to a Public Project.



**Desktop** 

* Enter the Project and click on the Project name.


* Click [Manage this Project], and then click [Convert to a Private Project].


* Click [Convert to a Private Project].


* Clicking [confirm] will convert the Project to Private.
