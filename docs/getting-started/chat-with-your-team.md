Chat With Your Team
===================

 Sending and receiving Messages in Swit is simple and intuitive. Just write the text in the input box of your chosen Channel and send the Message!

 Mentions
--------

 Use Mentions to get the attention of a specific Member or Members on your team. They will receive a Notification letting them know you mentioned them.

 Pin

 Pin relevant Files or important Messages to your Channel. This reduces the time spent looking for data and helps new Members learn about the Channel.

 Your Starred Items are only visible to you.

 File Sharing

----------------------------

 Swit allows you to multitask by chatting in two Channels at the same time! Chat in one Channel using the Content Canvas while chatting in another Channel using the Right Panel. Minimize switching back and forth so you can focus on conversations!
