# Failed or Late Payments

Failed or Late Payments
=======================

 Here at Swit, we do understand that sometimes accidents happen. Payments might arrive late or not at all due to certain personal complications, or issues with your credit card. The Super Admin, Workspace Master, or the Admin (with Billing Permissions) may change the Billing/Account information to ensure that Swit receives payment on time.

   
In our Terms and Services Agreement that you have signed, you have agreed to that

   
“...in the event Swit is unable to collect the fees owed to Swit for Your Account through Your Membership/Monthly Fee, Swit may take any other steps it deems necessary to collect such fees from You and that You will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Swit in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs, and attorneys' fees.”

 In Premium Tier, the Super Admin is the only one allowed to manage Billing Information. If payments are made late or failed due to credit card issues, we will follow the same procedures as your credit card company.
