# Roles and Permissions

Roles and Permissions
=====================

 Super Admin
-----------

 The Super Admin role can only be managed by one person at first, who will have access to multiple Workspaces at one time. With our Cross-Functional Workspace feature, the Super Admin will be able to view all of the Workspaces in his/her control on one dashboard, with real-time updates. As the Super Admin, you can now easily multi-task and ensure quality control over each Workspace. The Super Admin will be responsible for adding/removing Members from each Workspace(only applicable to Enterprise Tier), creating and deleting Workspaces, handle all Billing/Payment information, and responsible for any Upgrades/Downgrades.

 This feature will only be available to customers who have access to Swit Premium or Swit Enterprise. Depending on your permissions settings, you may be able to have more than one Super Admin, if necessary.

 Master
------

 The Master, by default, is the original creator of the Workspace. The Master can take any administrative action in the Workspace, from managing Channels, Projects, viewing Billing details, responsible for Upgrading and Downgrading, managing Task Cards, to adjusting Permission settings for Members of the Workspace.

 The role of Master can be transferred to another Member if need be. You will be able to have more than one (1) Master per Workspace at any given time.

 The Master does not have the ability to view Private Channels/Projects unless they have been invited, like any other Member.

 Admin
-----

 A Workspace Admin is appointed by the Workspace Master to oversee Workspace activities and to ensure efficient operations of the Workspace. The Admin has all the same powers as the Master, but with the sole distinction that the Admin is not the original creator of the Workspace, cannot delete Workspaces either or designate general Members as Managers. The Admin may also be responsible for Billing details/information if the Master grants these permissions.

 Host
----

 A Host is a member that has created a Channel, Project, or Task Card and thus is the "manager" or "owner" of that Channel/Project/Task Card. The Host may assign another Workspace Member permission to manage their task if they wish.

 Member
------

 Members are Workspace users with no other defined roles or permissions unless they are assigned certain permissions by the Master or Admin of the Workspace. Members will be allowed to create Channels, Projects, and Task Cards ONLY if they have permissions to do so.

 Guest
-----

 Guests are not permanent Members, and can only be invited into Workspaces with (at minimum) Swit Standard. Guests collaborate in the Workspace for a limited time only.

 Guests are not charged directly; The Master of the Workspace will be charged for each Guest being able to use a particular Workspace.
