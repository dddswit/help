**How to Use Invite Links**
   

   2. Inviting Members by entering their email addresses directly allows you to manage outsiders’ access more strictly. However, if you want to add multiple Members at once, simply generate an Invite Link for the Workspace and share the Link with the people you want to add.
 4. Description of the Invite Link Screen
  2. From the desktop, click your Workspace Name in the top left.
 4. Select “Invite new members”.
 6. Activate the “Get shareable invitation link” button. This generates an Invite Link with no expiration date by default.
 8. If users deactivate the “Get shareable invitation link” button, previously created Invite Links will no longer be available.
 10. A new Invite Link is generated each time users activate or deactivate the “Get shareable invitation link” button.
  8. Invite Links and Validity Periods / Expiration Dates
  2. A newly generated Invite Link has no expiration date by default. 
 4. You can change the validity period of Invite Links by selecting from the available options: 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, or no expiration. 
 6. A new Invite Link is generated each time you change its validity period, and the previously generated Invite Link rendered void. 
 8. If the invitation link has expired, the Copy button will be disabled. Instead, the text "Get the new invitation link" will appear at the bottom right-hand corner. Then click the "Get" button to create the invitation link without an expiration date.
 10. When potential Members click on an invitation link whose expiration date has expired, they are taken to an Invalid page (Invalid-This link is not available).
  12. How to join the Workspace through the invitation link
  2. If potential Members join the Workspace through an invitation link and they are logged in Swit, they can join the Workspace by clicking “Join Workspace”.
 4. If potential Members who get access through an invitation link are not logged into Swit, they can join the Workspace after the login or registration process.
