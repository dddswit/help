   Making the Connection
  </em>
 </strong>
 : Once you have clicked on the button, the following screen will appear.
</p>
<p>
 In order to use M Box, you need to link your G Suite account to your Swit. It should be noted that you must have G Suite account with Gmail enabled to make the integration.

</p>
<p>
 Congratulations! You have successfully integrated your G Suite into Swit! Now, you are ready to use M Box.
</p>
<p>
 Now that you have linked your email account in M ​​Box, you can use various functions provided by M Box. We now turn to this topic.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  <em>
   The Link is Very Good
  </em>
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The purpose of this section is to demonstrate how to effectively use the “M Box” features, with particular focus on the basic functions that M Box provides. In the next section, however, I will go deeper into the special features that M Box can provide. Let’s begin!
</p>
<p>
 2.1.
 <strong>
  <em>
   Inbox
  </em>
 </strong>
 : As soon as Swit and G Suite are connected to each other, the initial mailing list loads up to 20 emails. After that, you get 20 lists each time you scroll.
</p>
<p>
 2.2.
 <strong>
  <em>
   Account Information
  </em>
 </strong>
 : The linked account information is displayed at the bottom left.
</p>
<p>
 2.3.
 <strong>
  <em>
   Deletion
  </em>
 </strong>
 : If you want to remove the integration, move the cursor onto the icon with three dots. Clicking on the icon will give you the following message: “Delete the Linked account in M Box.” Click on it to proceed.
</p>
<p>
 Once you have clicked the message, the following warning will be displayed as shown in the picture below: “Will you delete the linked ‘your email address’ in M Box? You can link the account again in M Box if you delete the account.” Confirm to remove the linked account.
</p>
<p>
 2.4.
 <strong>
  <em>
   Refresh
  </em>
 </strong>
 : Default is to auto refresh every 3 minutes. However, you can manually refresh your email database by clicking the cycle arrow icon in the “Mail List” menu. Since, email data is not updated in real time, you must press the refresh button to load new mail data.
</p>
<p>
 2.5.
 <strong>
  <em>
   Composition
  </em>
 </strong>
 : It is time to compose an email. Locate the “Compose” button on your screen and click on it.
</p>
<p>
 I will send an email to
 <a href="mailto:Sanghwan.a.lee@gmail.com">
  "Sanghwan.a.lee@gmail.com"
 </a>
 to demonstrate. Of course, you can attach files stored on your computer. Please click on the “Attachment” button to use this feature.
</p>
<p>
 In the Content Browser, you can navigate through folders in different locations, search for a file, and then attach it.
</p>
<p>
 Once you have finished writing a message and attaching the file, click on the “Send” button on the top of the screen.
</p>
<p>
 Then, the confirmation indicator will be displayed, as shown in the picture below. Great job!
</p>
<p>
 As seen, two options will be given to you: (1) Move to “inbox” and (2) Move to “sent” email box. Please choose what fits best for your next task and then click on it. I will choose the latter option to demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
 2.6.
 <strong>
  <em>
   Sent
  </em>
 </strong>
 : Do you see what is in the red box? It shows the most recently sent email via M Box!
</p>
<p>
 2.7.
 <strong>
  <em>
   Policy
  </em>
 </strong>
 : Since we integrate G Suite to Swit’s platform without altering the former’s email usage policy, Swit follows G Suite’s policy. The followings are some examples of the rules: (1) Gmail Sending Limit, (2) Gmail Receiving Limit, (3) Attachment, (4) Carbon Copy, (5) Blind Carbon Copy.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  <em>
   Gmail Sending Limit
  </em>
 </strong>
 : This feature sets the maximum amount of emails that you can send in a day. You can send 500 emails/day with a regular Gmail account.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  <em>
   Gmail Receiving Limit
  </em>
 </strong>
 : This feature sets the maximum amount of emails that you can receive in a day. You can receive 500 emails/day with a regular Gmail account.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  <em>
   Attachment
  </em>
 </strong>
 : For example, when you send files larger than 25MB, Google automatically uploads them to Google drive.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  <em>
   Carbon Copy
  </em>
 </strong>
 (CC): This feature allows you to send an email to multiple recipients. However, when you use this feature, the primary recipients of the email will be aware of other recipients you have included. Hence, the CC feature ensures that all your recipients can see who has been added to your mail.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  <em>
   Blind Carbon Copy
  </em>
 </strong>
 (BCC): This feature allows you to send an email to multiple recipients. Yet, this feature will not allow the primary recipients of the email to be aware of other recipients you’ve included. Hence, it’s a little more confidential than CC.
</p>
<p>
 The Special Features are Very, Very Good
</p>
<p>
 The purpose of this section is to demonstrate two special features that M Box offers to our users: Transforming a Swit task card into an email and
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  vice versa
 </em>
 . Additionally, I will show you how to share any email directly to your chat.
</p>
<p>
 3.1.
 <strong>
  <em>
   From a task card to an email
  </em>
 </strong>
 : Please locate an icon with two rectangles in the right sidebar. When you hover over the icon, M Box will show the “channels” and “task cards” entries in a popup.
</p>
<p>
 Click on the “Tasks” button to proceed.
</p>
<p>
 Once you have clicked on the button, the Tasks window will be displayed on your screen as shown in the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>
 The first line under the title “Tasks” demonstrates a selected project in your workspace. Clicking on the dropdown menu will further show you all the existing projects so that you can pick and choose.
</p>
<p>
 I will choose the “Typos” project to demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
 The second dropdown menu will show you all the existing Task Cards in Bucket Views. It should be noted that you can view your Task Cards in five different views, each serving a specific purpose: (1) Status View, (2) Team View, (3) Timeline View, (4) Calendar View, and (5) Bucket View.
</p>
<p>
 I will choose the “Website” Bucket View to demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
 As you see, using the dropdown menu narrows down a search by specifying the desired options. Guess what? It is time to turn this Task Card entitled “Typo on Pricing Information on Website” to email content. Are you ready?
</p>
<p>
 Click on the “Compose” button to open an email screen.
</p>
<p>
 Once the email screen has appeared as below, move the mouse cursor over to the Task Card.
</p>
<p>
 Now, just simply drag and drop the Task Card to the email screen. The magic is about to begin! Are you ready?
</p>
<p>
 Wow! As shown in the screenshot below, the contents have been transferred from the Task Card to the email in message form.
</p>
<p>
 Let’s compare the original form and the email form to see how accurately the transfer took place. As you can see below, it worked like a charm!
</p>
<p>
 The Original Form
</p>
<p>
 The Email Form
</p>
<p>
 Here, I want to point out one more amazing feature. Notice that the “drag and drop” action has automatically included one email account in the To section and two email accounts in the CC section. This inclusion has taken place because those account holders have been assigned as the Assigned member (i.e. ian@swit.io) and as the followers (i.e., sophia@swit.io and jina@swit.io) of the Task Card. The “drag and drop” action intuitively recognizes this information and automatically includes them in the corresponding sections. Isn’t this amazing? Now, the email is ready to be sent!
</p>
<p>
 Guess what? There is another way to transform a Task Card into an email. Please go to any Task Card that you desire to transform and locate the icon with three dots.
</p>
<p>
 When you click on it, a box with five options will appear. Choose the “Send mail” option.
</p>
<p>
 Then Swit will transform the selected Task Card into an email!
</p>
<p>
 3.2.
 <strong>
  <em>
   From an Email to a Task Card
  </em>
 </strong>
 : Let’s say that you have received an email. You can transform it into a shareable and trackable Task Card! First, go to the “Inbox” section and locate the Task Card that you have received in email form.
</p>
<p>
 Once you have clicked on it, the following screen will appear.
</p>
<p>
 Locate the “Generate the Task by Email” button on the top middle section on the task bar. Then click on it to proceed. Magic is about to happen!
</p>
<p>
 Once you have clicked on the button, the following screen will appear. Here you can choose the Project you want to send the email to as well as give a name to your Task. In the dropdown menu under the “Select Project” section, I will choose the “Integration Walkthrough” project to demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
 Guess what? You can also change the “Take Tile” name to best fit your need. I will change the title from “Typo on Pricing Information on Website” to “M Box Integration Walkthrough Demon” to demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
 Then I will write “Demonstrate” in the “Details” box to demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
 It is time to click on the “Confirm” button. Once you have clicked on it, the following screen will appear.
</p>
<p>
 I will choose to go to task details.
</p>
<p>
 Then, you will be led to a newly generated Task Card page.
</p>
<p>
 Congratulations! You have successfully transferred an email to a Task Card! Yet, there is more to see!
</p>
<p>
 Please locate the email emoticon and click on it. A box will appear on your screen, showing the contents of the email that you use to generate this Task Card.
</p>
<p>
 This feature will save you from going back and forth to view the contents of the email to recapture your work.
</p>
<p>
 3.3.
 <strong>
  <em>
   From an Email to a Task Card
  </em>
 </strong>
 : Surprisingly, you can share email directly to your chat. Let’s say that you have an email that you want to share in team chat. What you first need to do is open the email in M Box.
</p>
<p>
 Then, locate an icon with two rectangles in the right sidebar. When you hover over the icon, M Box will show the “channels” and “task cards” entries in a popup.
</p>
<p>
 Click on the “Channel” icon to proceed.
</p>
<p>
 Once you have clicked on the icon, the “Channel” bar will be displayed, as shown in the picture below.
</p>
<p>
 It is time to locate the “Share Mail into the Chat” link and then click on it.
</p>
<p>
 Then the following box will appear on your screen.
</p>
<p>
 Here you can choose which channel to use as the destination for the email.
</p>
<p>
 I will choose the “SFDC integration” channel and write “Demo” in the “Description” box to demonstrate. Then, click on the “Confirm” button to proceed.
</p>
<p>
 Do you see what I see? Look at the bottom right side of your screen.
</p>
<p>
 You have successfully shared the email!
</p>
<p>
 Now, let’s click the “Swit Empowers Salesforce” link.
</p>
<p>
 Once you have clicked the link, the content of the email will appear in the reading pane. Isn’t this amazing? You can share email directly to your chat, and the chat members get instantly updated on the email without having to open their inbox!
</p>
<p>
 Guess what? There is another way to share email directly to your chat. First, locate the email that you want to share in team chat.
</p>
<p>
 Second, simply drag and drop the email to the Chatting box.
</p>
<p>
 When the “Share Your Mail” box appears, choose what fits best for your task and then click the “Confirm” button. I will choose the “SFDC integration” Channel and write “Demo 2” in the “Description” box to demonstrate. Then, click on the “Confirm” button to proceed.
</p>
<p>
 Now, look at the bottom right side of your screen. Congratulations! You have successfully shared the email!
</p>
<p>
