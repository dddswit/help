# I Want to Build a New Workspace

Great! A Workspace is a space shared by multiple Members. Follow this guide and you'll have a new Workspace for your team in no time.

 You will need a Swit account to build a new Workspace. If you do not have an account yet, please visit [this link](https://swit.io/auth/register).

 Build a New Workspace
---------------------

 Let's build a new Workspace. On the Swit Home, click [build a new Workspace]. Name your team and your URL.

 Manage Workspace Settings and Permissions
-----------------------------------------

 Once the Workspace is created, you can invite Members. Members invited to the Workspace have access to certain Permissions depending on their Role (Super Admin, Master, Admin, Host, Member, or Guest).

 To manage Roles and Permissions for Members (such as their ability to invite more Members), go to Permissions and make changes as needed. For more information, see [Set Workspace Permissions](https://help.swit.io/feature/19021808473085p1BBi/1902260525213uEbops).

 Invite New Members to a Workspace
---------------------------------

 Once you've set up your Workspace, you can start inviting Members to it. In Workspace Settings, click Manage Invitations. You can send an invitation to someone by entering their email address in the appropriate field.
