# Channel

  What is the difference between Chat and Ideation? Chatting can sometimes be too fast-paced, which may lead to certain disadvantages. The purpose of Ideation is to allow you brainstorm more thoughtfully than you would in chat. Use Ideation to jot down ideas, discuss them, and record opinions on a topic.   What is the difference between Stars and Pins? Pins hold important messages or files in an easily accessible location within a Channel, allowing for quick access by all members. A Star is a feature that allows you to bookmark information for you to easily return to, and is not shared with other members.   Can I create tasks in Chat? You can create task cards directly from Chat without having to go to the Project Box. To create a new Channel, click the [plus icon] next to the Channels list, then enter the name for the new Channel. Select the member(s) you would like to invite. While writing a purpose is optional, it can help keep the Channel conversation focused.   Can I share task cards in Chat? You can share task cards in Chat using the Side Tab. Start by opening the Side Tab in the Project that contains the card you want to share. Select the Chat you want in the Side Tab, then drag and drop the task card into the Side Tab.
