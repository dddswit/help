  Do I need a new email every time I create a workspace? Nope! You can create multiple workspaces with one email account.   Can I change my account email or add a new email? You can manage your email addresses by going into Account Settings. You can change the primary email address for your account or specify different email addresses for each workspace.   What are the differences between workspace Owners, Admins, Managers, and regular Members? The Owner is the person who created and owns the workspace. An Admin is a person who has been given permission from the Owner to manage the workspace. A Manager is a person who manages Channels or Projects. A regular Member is a person who doesn't have a role, but can be a manager by creating Channels and Projects. For more information, see Set Workspace Permissions.
