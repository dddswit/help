=============

 Now that your Workspace is ready, it's time to create a Task Card as your first step toward Project completion!

 Create a Task
-------------

 Creating Task Cards is easy. In the Backlog of a Project, click [Add a card]. Enter your Task Title and a Card will be created.

-------

 Backlog is similar to a to-do list that contains the Tasks required for a Project. You can move Task Cards created in Backlog to different columns within the five Project Views, or return them to the Backlog if you change your mind.

 You can close Backlog when you are not using it.

 Views
-----

 Each column has five Display Views, and you can alternate Views at any time. Change your View according to what works best for you!

 ### Status View

 See Tasks grouped by progress: To-Do, Doing, and Done.

 Add Task Details
----------------

 Click a Task Card to view and manage its details (i.e. Due Date, assigned Member, etc.).

 ### Checklists and Items

 Checklists allow you to break down Tasks in detail and keep track of your progress. Checklists are comprised of Items, which are smaller and more manageable pieces of a Task.

 ### Task Priority

 Focus on what's most important by prioritizing Tasks on one of five Priority levels.

 ### Due Date

 Set a Due Date to specify a Taskâ€™s expected duration.

 You can view and manage all Tasks currently in progress in the Today Right Panel. For more information, see [Today Right Panel](https://help.swit.io/feature/1902180850260lVE2Fh/1902281153463vEunBA).

 ### Assigning a Task

 You can assign a Member to a Task in order to designate who is responsible for its completion. Additionally, any Member can follow the Task for progress updates. When a Task Card is updated, Notifications are automatically sent to its assigned Member, its Host, and any Member who is following it.

 ### Tags and Color Labels

 Tags and Color Labels are additional ways to classify Tasks. They are also helpful for finding Task Cards by filter Search later on.
